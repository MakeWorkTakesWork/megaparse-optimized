We chose Fin to be powered by a mix of models, including OpenAl's GPT-4. Using GPT-4
was a conscious choice to choose accuracy, quality, and safety over cost. While it isn't the
cheapest LLM (Large Language Model) in the market, it is by a margin the most accurate
and far less prone to hallucinations compared with the alternatives [that most of our
competitors are currently usingl. We've also created our own ML rails to ensure that Fin 1)
asks clarifying questions, 2) acknowledges when it doesn't know an answer and 3)
seamlessly passes conversations off to your human support team when it reaches the
bounds of its knowledge. We're focused on ensuring your customers have the most
positive experiences.

Most (if not all) of the chat bots you're considering don't price against Resolutions.
Answers, Deflections, or Questions Asked are all common ways of pricing customer
service chatbots. We have strong conviction that Resolutions is the most proximal metric to
value for you as a company but also for your customers. And you only pay when a
conversation is resolved.

Fin is priced at cost: "Fin is priced low to enable Intercom customers to take advantage of
the generational shift we're experiencing with Al and to quickly realize the impact of
Al-powered customer service with Intercom."

# Will Fin "hallucinate, i.e., give incorrect answers, like ChatGPT?

Fin is powered by Intercom's patented Al Engine" "M. It allows Fin to refine every query, optimize
every response and validate the quality of each answer. As a result, it's the only AI agent that
balances industry-high resolutions with industry-low halucinations. Most companies take the
cheaper and easier route when building an Al Agent by applying a 'wrapper to a generative Large
Language Model (LLM), instead of building on them. Without Intercom's system, which refines the
LLM's inputs and outputs, an Al agent cannot be optimized for accuracy and reliability. Currently,
for customers handling 250+ conversations per month, Fin has a 30-day resolution rate of 52%.
But we've seen clients push that to 86%.

Through the Knowledge Hub, you can control, update, and manage all content that Fin uses ensuring
that your information is always up-to-date and relevant. Features such as Content Targeting give you
control over exactly which content Fin leverages, ensuring responses are customized for your
audience. Plus, with custom answers, you can incorporate rich media, external data (like order
history or billing info), and trigger custom actions (such as writing to third-party systems), delivering
exceptional customer experiences.


### # How much of our current workload will be handled by Fin?


Most customer questions fall into three categories: Informational, Personalized - tailored
responses specific to the individual, Actionable - where actions need to be taken or issues
resolved. Fin is designed to do more than answer informational questions -it can deliver
personalized solutions and take action. Fin currently has an average 30-day resolution rate of
52%. But we've seen clients push that to 86%.

To maximize the impact that Fin has on your support strategy our team can work with you on
nu ur merous S levers including:

Target Specific Audiences: Deploy Fin based on audience, region, or channel- -keeping
support available even after hours.

Scale Internationally: Expand to new markets effortlessly, even without localized content.

accurate and helpful answers.

Introduce Personalized Answers: Fin can personalize its service for every customer and
take actions on their behalf going beyond answering questions and actually resolving
problems.


### # Will Fin take jobs away from support teams?


We see Humans & Al play different but equally important roles. Al will do a large percent of the tier
1 support work whereas Humans will resolve the more complex queries PLUS upsell, spot churn
risk, detect themes, empathize deescalate.

The leading factor in the Fin success story for many of our most successful Fin customers is the
opportunity it creates for their people. Fin drastically increases customer support capacity and
bandwidth which in turn creates growth opportunities for agents. We see teams

Pivoting support agents to success roles and subsequently becoming revenue drivers for
the business,

Running strategic initiatives that have been put on the backburner for years, e.g.
experimenting with phone support and deeply investing in knowledge base and help
content.

Shifting resources to dedicate a percentage of time to monitoring and improving Fin's
performance.

We do however see Fin impacting future hiring as the human team will no longer grow
proportionally to inbound volume.


### How is Fin different from our current bots/automation?



### See the Fin Landing Page for the latest value proposition.

Transparent: Fin Conversations in Inbox lets your team easily monitor all of Fin's
responses.

Control when you want it: Custom Answers allow you to create bespoke answers to your
most important questions, and Fin will prioritize them over its Al Answers.

Human when you need it: Fin can triage complex problems and seamlessly pass them to
your human support teams SO your customers get the best possible experience.

Conversational: A true natural language bot, Fin can understand complex queries, ask
claritying questions, and fully converse with your customers.

Model mix: Fin uses a mix of models, including OpenAl's GPT-4, alongside Intercom's own
proprietary Al technologies to respond quickly and accurately to customer queries. Fin
always uses the model best suited to the task at hand, whether that's formulating answers,
disambiguating questions, or providing greetings.

Seamless integration: Fin works natively with the best full-service customer service
platform in the world - Intercom.


### # Why would want Fin and Custom Answers/Resolution Bot?


Fin's Custom Answers work to supercharge Fin's Al answer: 0 by powering additional
conversation use cases:

Answer questions not fulfilled by your support content: Create Custom Answers
that are highly targeted to specific segments with content or information that is not
in existing support content.

Answer questions with rich media: Custom Answers can include video or images,
unlike Fin. Does your customer already have a host of great video content that they
want to be able to serve directly to customers in automated conversations? Custom
Answers can do this.

Answer questions with Custom Actions and Custom Objects:

Custom Actions allow you to build no-code integrations for Custom
Answers to get live data (objects) and take actions in your external systems
(such as Salesforce).

Custom Objects provide more Tlexibility to model your customer data in a
way that makes sense for your business helping you achieve more
advanced automation. Store any type of data, such as Orders, Transactions,
Delivery data, Account info, etc., define how they reference each other, and
pull them into Fin via Custom Answers.

Answer questions with Custom Apps: E.g.
https://www.intercom.com/app-store/Pcapabllity-operator

o Create Custom Answers for common/repetitive questions: Is Fin answering the
same question again and again? Create a Custom Answer sO you can effectively
predict and manage spend more effectively (versus Al Answers that are charged
per Resolution).

# Will - have access to customer chat history handled by Fin?

Yes, this will be available to all customers at launch. You'll be able to see performance metrics as
well as a dedicated inbox view sO you can filter and review all conversations handled by Fin.

# - have Workflows doing this for free. Why would implement Fin?

Workflows are great for automating specific tasks, like handling multi-step processes, but they're
limited in personalization and flexibility. Fin enhances Workflows by integrating advanced Al to
deliver more tailored and connected customer experiences, something standalone automations
can't achieve.

can't achieve.

Reduces setup & maintenance: Fin can handle the nuances of customer queries that
manual workflows might miss. Fin also learns from your knowledge base, providing
accurate answers without the need to update workflows after each product change.

Improves customer experience: With Fin you can automate more queries, cutting down on
repetitive, complex workflows and improving the overall customer experience.

Increased erficiency: Seamlessly hand off conversations between Fin and your team
based on customer behavior or business hours.

Gain greater control: Customize how Fin interacts with customers, using attributes or
oehaviors, and better manage handoffs to human agents.

But combining Fin Al Agent with Workflows' triggers, conditions, and actions allows you to
supercharge your workflow automations to create truly personalized and connected customer
experiences that would be impossible with standalone Al chatbots.
* have resolution bot doing this for free. Why would implement Fin?

Resolution bots or chatbots are indeed Al powered, SO when a customer asks a question it uses ML
to work out what the best answer is, however Chatbots dont not have logic trees and can't create
answers, the bank of possible answers has to first be created and stored which is a significant
resource suck.

In contrast Al Agents use generative Al to understand, respond and action customer queries. In
short, chatbots return predefined information, while Al Agents reason.

Our Al Agent can now answer more questions, in more ways, in more places-while giving you more
control over its quality of support.

Fin to answer even more complex questions with confidence and precision. It can instantly
pull from a broad array of sources and craft the most accurate, detailed response from the
most relevant information.

Fin can automatically translate support content and respond in over 45 languages,
eliminating the need for you to manually localize content to serve your multilingual
customer base.

Fin can personalize its service for every customer and take actions on their behalf going
beyond answering questions and actually resolving problems.

You can guide Fin to match your brand's unique tone of voice, ensuring a consistent and
seamless customer experience.

Fin can follow your guidance to handle sensitive topics like billing, cancellations, or refunds
in a specific way.

Fin can recognize topics and route them to the right team, ensuring compliance with your
company policies.

While focusing on human support is important, implementing Al solutions like Fin can accelerate
your team's erticiency and capacity right away. Many of our clients see a 50% resolution rate in

# We need to get our human support in order before implementing any Al solutions

While focusing on human support is important, implementing Al solutions like Fin can accelerate
your team's erticiency and capacity right away. Many of our clients see a 50% resolution rate in

the first few months because Fin handles informational questions out of the box, and Fin 2 now
addresses personalized, customer-specific queries and takes actions to resolve issues.

This increases bandwidth for your human support team to focus on more complex queries and
opens up new growth opportunities, such as:


### 1. Shifting agents to success roles, driving revenue.



### 2. Experimenting with new channels like phone or email.


1. Investing more deeply in knowledge bases and help center content.

Fin Al Agent is also a critical tool if your goal is to run an efficient org allowing you to scale without
needing to grow your support team in direct proportion to customer growth.

Also Fin Al Copilot is a great way to dip your toe into Al because your agents have full control over
the answers that the customer sees. Agents always have the option to edit the answer before it
gets sent to customers and they can always check the sources of the generated answers in detail.
As with Fin Al Agent, Copilot only ever generates answers S based on your support content and
conversations. Nothing else. Managers have full control over the content and conversations Fin Al
Copilot can pull from

# My team is thinking of building our own solution in house.

There are several key drawbacks to building your own solution in house. Some things to consider

Total Cost of Ownership: With Fin 2, you don't have to think about all the additional costs,
these are all taken into consideration within our pricing meaning that you never pay more
than $0.99 per resolution.

Time to value: On average, most in-house Al Agents take 6-9 months to build and deploy
and 75% of these Al Agent projects fail (Source). With Fin Al Agent, you can be up and
running within a day and see half of your support volume automated instantly.

Pace of Innovation: The rapid pace of Al innovation makes it increasingly difficult to keep
up. Cutting edge technology today can be obsolete in a matter of weeks or months
meaning that there are a lot of costs associated with staying up to date. You have your own
core business that you have to focus on innovating within sO having to do the same for
your CS team can be a big distraction and not the best use of your financial and human
resources.

At intercom we have a dedicated team of ML experts who have been building and maintaining our
ML products for years and we have support for when something goes awry.

What really sets us apart is our proprietary Al Engine". While many Al agents optimize for
either high resolution or low hallucination, they rarely do both. That's because it's easier
and cheaper to apply a simple 'wrapper' around a generative Large Language Model (LLM)
and call it an Al agent.

Without a system like Intercom's, which actively refines LLM inputs and outputs, Al agents
are prone to nalucihations-leading to incorrect or irrelevant information being provided to
your customers. Fin 2 is designed specifically for customer service and leverages the

either high resolution or low hallucination, they rarely do both. That's because it's easier
and cheaper to apply a simple 'wrapper' around a generative Large Language Model (LLM)
and call it an Al agent.

Without a system like Intercom's, which actively refines LLM inputs and outputs, Al agents
are prone to nalucihations-leading to incorrect or irrelevant information being provided to
your customers. Fin 2 is designed specifically for customer service and leverages the

strengths of LLMS while minimizing their limitations, ensuring the highest levels of
accuracy, reliability, and customer satisfaction in the industry.


### # How can Al's deliver a positive customer experience?


Fin 2 is designed to act like your best customer service agent, using all your knowledge 50 ou urces
both public and private to craft accurate and relevant responses. It pulls from the most reliable
information to deliver detailed accurate answers.

Fin's communication can be customized to match your brand's tone, and you can give it guidance
to handle sensitive topics like billing or refunds. It even recognizes these topics and routes them to
the right team to ensure compliance with your policies.

Beyond providing answers, Fin personalizes the customer experience and takes action to resolve
issues, just like your best human agents. Speed is also key- Fin resolves issues quickly, ensuring
fast and efficient responses.

With Fin's overview report, you can track key metrics like resolution rate, response time, and CSAT,
gaining insights into both human and automated support performance. You'll see trends in
customer satisfaction and identify topics driving lower scores, enabling continuous improvement.

Don't take our word for it though:

"We surpassed our 2024 goal of 35% automated resolution, achieving 42% with a 97%
Fin Al CSAT." Sam Miller, Customer Support Operations Manager, Dental intelligence.

"Fin now handles 60% of our tickets while maintaining a 95% CSAT." Robb Clarke, Head
of Technical Operations, RB2B.

I am concerned about the Privacy and Security implications of Al.

To ensure the robustness of Intercom's Al-backed features, we have implemented strategies to
mitigate a wide range of threats.

LLMS can be vulnerable to manipulation or hallucinations, potentially atfecting customers. To
ensure safety and reliability, Intercom's Al engine" has been designed with strict safety controls in
place. If the necessary parameters for safety have not been met at any point, Fin will notify users
and escalate to human support. Learn more about Fin's safety m eas sures on trust.intercom.com.

Intercom has implemented state-of-the-art security, including protection against OWASP LLM Top
10 threats. By consistently testing a variety of high-end LLMS, deploying rigorous internal controls,
security protocols, and safeguards, Fin is able to achieve the highest level of security and reliability
while avoiding potential limitations and threats.

That means you and your customers can always trust Fin's answers as the safest, most accurate,
and reliable of any Al agent. Learn more about Fin's safety measures on trust.ntercom.com.

### # Ithought Al can only resolve knowledge based queries?


The majority of customer questions fit into one of three categories: Informational - straightforward
requests for information, Personalized - tailored responses specific to the individual, Actionable
where actions need to be taken or issues resolved.

We built Fin to be able to answer all of these questions:

With the knowledge you give it, Fin is able to answer informational questions right out of
the box.

By easily connecting Fin to your internal or external data sources like Stripe or say Shopify
for example Fin can provide personal service and individual answers to each of your
customers.

And using those same data sources, you can teach Fin to take action on behalf of your
customers by updating customer records = helping your customers with things like
payment issues, changing a subscription or amending an order as an example.

On top of all this. Fin can hold every single piece of data in its head, and can answer any customer
instantly = saving your team valuable time and delivering a higher quality customer experience and
uitimately turning frustrated customers into happy ones.

How do you define Accuracy and how does Fin handle Hallucinations?


### When asked what we mean by Accuracy


Intercom's definition of accuracy: Accuracy in this context refers to the ability of Fin to address
the original query with responses based solely on the customer's support content.


### If asked to elaborate on how Fin is accurate


How does Fin achieve high levels of accuracy: To achieve the highest level of accuracy Fin
combines our industry-leading capabilities with the patented Fin Al EngineTM - designed
specifically for customer service.

Fin learns your support content and policies to generate highly accurate, personalized answer o
and implement the right behaviors and policies, every time. Your team controls the knowledge Fin
learns from and creates the guidelines around which conversations Fin handles and how it
responds SO you can keep answers accurate and complete as your business changes and grows.

In parallel the patented Fin Al Engine" ensures Fin refines every query, optimizes every response
and validates the quality of each answer meaning Fin will only provide a response if it meets the
necessary response confidence and is grounded in your knowledge sources.


### Ifasked a technical follow up about halucinations


How does Fin manage and avoid halucinations: LLMs are prone to hallucinations and can
expose customers to incorrect or irrelevant information without a system to refine their inputs and
outputs. That is where the patented Intercom Al Engine" comes in, using a three-step process to
ensure accuracy and relevancy while mitigating hallucinations:

ensure accuracy and relevancy while mitigating hallucinations:

The Fin Al Engine' - ensures that each customer message is first refined for clarity and
context before processing, checking for Workflows and Custom Answer triggers, and
filtering out topics Fin shouldn't be answering.

A bespoke retrieval augmented generation architecture (RAG for short) is then used to
retrieve relevant content from your approved knowledge sources, which is then combined
with the user's prompt to reduce inaccuracies like hallucinations before sending to the
LLM. Our Al group has invested heavily in optimizing our unique application of RAG and
continuously tests both the accuracy of the LLM and the individual steps of RAG to improve
overall performance.

Finally the Fin Al Engine" performs checks to validate that the output from the LLM meets
the necessary response confidence and whether the response is grounded in your
approved knowledge resources.

perfect. They are built on statistical patterns, and as such, occasionally they may return an

## # Can we upload our own brand and Tone of Voice Guidelines?


Currently Fin can be customized using a default set of options including to speak in your preferred
tone of voice, whether professional, friendly, or humorous. It can also adjust the length of its
responses.

Can Fin help detect and prevent phishing attempts and other spam attempts

Fin Al Agent integrates with Intercom built-in spam filtering to ensure Fin doesn't reply to spam
emails. Intercom assigns all inbound emails a score and will filter anything that is deemed to be
"spammy". These messages are filters to the Spam folder from the Help Desk which can be
checked in the event that you feel you are missing any emails.


### How does Fin personalize customer interactions?


Fin personalizes its responses by accessing customer data and taking actions based on specific
needs, ensuring a tailored experience acros S channels like email, SMS, and social media.

By creating an 'Action', you allow Fin to acc cess your internal or external data sources, enabling it to
provide personalized answe er rs and perform complex tasks on behalf of your customers such as
retrieving data from internal or external data sources/systems. If a customer wants to know the
status of a purchase order, Fin can provide them an update based on real-time data from 3rd party
sources. Ready made action templates can be used to connect Fin to the data sourc 6 5 you may
