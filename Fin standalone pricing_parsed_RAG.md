### Fin Standalone pricing



### Stages of Fin SA pricing strategy



### Pilot: (current stage) how are we monetising in the pilot


SOT pricing description in WWB Doc.  Solution is currently scrappy by design

We may iterate here depending on near term feedback if P&P is a barrier to adoption

Scale: what's the SS approach? What’s a more robust solution?

We will not be doing this in the near term.  Goal is to prep and size the solution so that we’re ready when the time comes.  Thinking around Fin SA SS in Operation Win Fin -- SA Self-serve Fin Standalone - PnP Estimations

Optimise: Should we/ how do we better match price to value for SA?  How do we address any pain points of the SA commercial offering?


### This phase will come later (not before Q2)


Goals:

The primary goal of Fin Standalone is to drive customer resolutions and expand adoption (logos) by providing Fin's AI-powered capabilities to customers who do not use the Intercom platform. This offering should align with our broader resolution objectives while ensuring effectiveness and accessibility for high-value and very high-volume support customers (HVSC and VHVSC) and to help us to acquire strategic logos.

Secondary goals for SS:

Customers like to trial products themselves before speaking with an agent,


### Expansion lever for full platform


Scale requirements:


## MVP


Summary: Customers will pay for resolutions and will have free access to core platform capabilities to make using Fin successful (unlimited seats).

In order to be successful as a Fin SA user, I need to be able to use some of the Intercom platform functionalities

Needed seat based features:


### All Fin features



### Incl custom answers



### Reduced version of knowledge hub



### Fin actions (+apps there)



### Access to Messenger



### Slimmed down version



### Multi-brand [expert]



### Messenger



### Knowledge hub


Workflows (limit what components within workflows) [advanced]

Custom reports (we’ve built bespoke custom reports that you can edit) [advanced]


### Settings



### Office hours [expert]



### General teammate Fin settings



### Billing


In Q1 we’ll have a read only view of the inbox (team to design and build in Q1


### SSO [expert]



### HIPAA/BAA [expert]



### Don’t Need



### Proactive features (checklists)



### Human agent replies



### Help center



### Real time reporting



### Copilot



### Messenger features



### Apps and integrations



### Phone



### Non-messenger channels (serviced by integration platform)


Right now there is 1 Fin SA experience.  In the future this might change (can have platform seat and then a SA seat)

Can only have parts of workflows if you have a stand alone seat

Customers should be able to add an unlimited amount of Fin SA seats at no extra charge.

New SA customers should be able to have a cardless free trial for SA, same length as platform cardless trial

Solution needs to include making Fin SA clear in billing summary and on invoices to avoid any customer confusion

Solution would ideally be extendable across SL with the same requirements


### Fast follows


There should be an upgrade path from Fin SA to the full intercom platform

Customers should be able to migrate from Fin SA to the full intercom platform in phases.  EG  a Fin SA customer might decide to move in phases by routing one type of question to Intercom while keeping Fin SA on all other conversations

This can be done through different workspaces for SA and full platform and you can copy Fin configuration over [current set up]

We should also support downgrading from full platform to SA (although lower priority and can be scoped out to start)

New SA customers should be able to have a 1 month cardless free trial for SA

Out of scope but things we may consider in the future (in case helpful for solutioning)


### Fin annual buckets on SS



### Free usage limit in the free trial window



### Optimise thinking


There will later be opportunity to optimise Fin SA pricing.  As we’re currently focus on adoption, we will not make these investments but capturing here for future investigation.

Today we are likely under monetizing Fin SA because with free seats customers can benefit from free:

Fin assists (when a customer helps to disambiguate the Q but doesn’t resolve it


### AI topics and category detection



### Passing the conversation



### Workflows


Today we give away some enterprise features for free (eg HIPA and SSO) we may decide to charge for this functionality in a different way (eg add-on)

Not cost effective in cheaper geo regions (eg Philippines) would we offer geo based pricing/ discounts?

Would we offer different time intervals for resolutions on different channels


### EG 24 hours short on emails

### How do you envision upgrade/ downgrade paths?


What if a SA customers wants to migrate to the intercom platform.  Today these come in phases.  Is there a world within the main platform you can configure Zendesk and Salesforce as a channel? Would you migrate the SA seat to

When migrating from Zendesk to Intercom, might do that in phases.  Will need to have full platform alongside SA.  Benefit: Could have 1 centralised Fin configuration, could also have Proactive in the same workspace

OR we might decide to have different workspaces for SA and full platform and you can copy Fin configuration over [current set up]


### Easier/ focused set up and experience



### SA -> full platform and full platform -> SA


Would we want a free trial/ free usage experience?  Should it be cardless?


### Cardless free trial


Is 2 weeks to short? No one has properly evaluate it in 2 weeks, 1 month feels more realistic


### 1 week set up



### 3 weeks of data


Inclusion is more interesting.  You can use it up to a certain amount of usage in a set time period


### Daily free limited amount



### SIngle bucket that are not timebound



### Would we offer Fin annual buckets on standalone SS?



### No to start


Would we ever charge for (definition or price) differently for SA or platform?


### Unlikely



### Are there different needs to be met for SS and SL?



### None that come to mind



### Onboarding packages (not available SS)



### # Patrick’s key questions



### Should we allow customers to get SA via SS?



### Should we allow SA customers to move to platform?



### Granola notes



## # Product Overview


Goal:


### Driving resolutions



### Logos



### Is fin standalone an accelerant to our resolution goal?



### Is as good or effective



### To what degree can we capture HVSC?


We acquired 35 VHVSC (15K+ a month) last year, does Fin standalone enable us to come close to that?


### Too early to consider margin guardrails



### Super generous about incentives - no worry about cost



### Pain points



### Not cost effective in cheaper geo regions



### Philippines



### Time intervals



### 24 hours short on emails



### We’re giving a lot away with workflows



### What counts as a resolution



### Still there with Fin + platform



### Why Fin if I’ve got workflows?



### Bring down seat price and offset with usage based metrics
