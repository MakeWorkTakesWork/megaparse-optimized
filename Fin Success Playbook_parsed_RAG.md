### Fin Success Playbook


Last updated: Jan 27, 2025 | Status: | Questions Fergal Cullen Daryl O'Regan

What is this Playbook: This playbook contains everything you need to run a successful Fin 40/40 Motion from start to finish including all of the steps and tools necessary to analyse and optimize Fin’s performance. 40/40 Eligibility Criteria: 15k+ conversations per month and Below 40% Resolution rate; and/ or Below 40% Involvement rate How to use it: The recommendation is to use the playbook start to finish for every Fin 40/40 Motion. However, the playbook has been developed in a modular way so that you can jump between sections without needing additional context. Use your best judgement. What does success look like: For Intercom, success means supporting our customers to achieve 'healthy adoption' with Fin. We define this as at least 40% Involvement Rate, 40% Resolution Rate, guardrailed by Fin CSAT averages comparable to customer human CSAT.

### Stage 1: Assessment



### Initial Account Audit


Objective: Secure Buy in, determine customer readiness, gather the essential account context and kick off the 40/40 motion.

Steps Details Resources Poor Health Identification Customer is identified as unhealthy - low involvement rate; low res rate Tableau Dashboard (filtered for 40/40 customers)
Loom Video for Tableau dashboard Request a Finsights deck for your account Go to the Finsights Deck Request Tracker to request personalized conversation taxonomy and Automation Potential slides for a specific customer. Join the #automated-finsights Slack channel where decks which will be shared every Monday. For any issues please post in #automated-finsights. (note 10th Jan on New FinSights 40/40 deck: For now, add the app or account ID to the tracker with a note that you are requesting the Finsights 40/40 deck and the date of the meeting you need the deck for. These are not yet automated so only request it if a meeting is scheduled. Finsights Desk Request Tracker Loom outlining the proAutomation Potential and Issue Recognition Account ID requestcess. Drive Folder with Automated FinSights Decks Secure Customer Buy-In Reach out to customers to Secure Buy-in and investment for Fin Success Plan using draft email template as a starting point. Requirements: Customer must have a clear Intention to improve Fin in the next few weeks Customer must have a high-level understanding of Fin commercials Optional: Feel free to add insights from the taxonomy analysis to improve and personalize your message. Defer to your own best practices with specific customers. EMEA: Email template NAMER: Email template Assuming Buy in Create Fin Success Plan To start with, we need the following sections filled out in the Fin Success Planner: Account Overview Success Criteria Optimization Guide - Aim to have this started to have a more productive conversation during the kick off call Plan of Action - Aim to have this started to have a more productive conversation during the kick off call See here for the Fin Success Planner Template Create comms channels (internal and external) External Channel for Customer Comms Name Slack Channel: #ext-intercom-{customer-name} Invite customer project team and ideally, customer leadership Invite GTM (RM, CSM management, RM management) and as needed, R&D teams supporting this customer Internal Public Slack Channel Name slack channel: #accounts- {customer-name} Note: At this point CSMs should be informing RMs as this may impact commercials down the line.


### Fin Success Kick Off


Objective: Provide the customer with a detailed analysis of their current support volume and query taxonomy, and secure their commitment to provide necessary resources.

Steps Details Resources Create Fin Success Kick-off Deck Find your Finsights Deck here Use only the slides you feel relevant e.g if they have strong resolution rate feel free to skip that section and just focus on involvement rate and vice versa Review all headers and textboxes. These will need to be adapted depending on the data. For any questions related to your customers data or analysis please use the #automated-finsights Slack channel Add in the Customer Goals & Challenges captured from the Fin Success planner Add any relevant Fin slides from the ‘Updated Intercom Solutions Narrative’ to provide context Fin 2. Use your discretion on what slides are relevant based on the customer's level of Fin education. Add quantitative/qualitative data and recommendations that you’ve identified from your initial workspace analysis Add AI Actions Recommendations - See here for details on steps to generate these. Note this takes ~30 mins to run. Please also link the deck in the customer's Success Plan. Drive Folder with Automated FinSights Decks Updated Intercom Solutions narrative for additional Fin slides. Good Kick off examples: Xpler | Recording Avocado | Recording Perplexity | Recording Kick-Off Call Note: 80% of the call should be focused on the workspace analysis, personalized conversation taxonomy and Automation Potential slides from Finsights. Book a 45min meeting to give time to cover the following: Run introductions, review agenda, recap goals. Provide context on Fin 2 & opportunities (if relevant, use your discretion on customer's level of Fin education) Align on goals, KPIs and measurement (min 40/40 and Fin CSAT) FinSights Analysis Workspace opportunities for optimization Quick same day fixes Optimizations over the next week and beyond Close call with next steps Outcomes: Secure buy-in (resource & time) from customer on any specific actions required from them Secure approvals to review critical data and make changes on their behalf.


### Project Management


Objective: Ensure that all priorities, updates and requests are tracked and reported on so that your 40/40 motion runs smoothly and doesn’t lose momentum.

Steps Details Resources Weekly list of priorities Share the list of priorities with the customer on a weekly basis through the external slack channel above. Strikethrough items as they’re completed. See here for project management templates. Internal weekly updates Share a weekly progress update in the #accounts-{customer-name} channel. See here for project management templates. Feature Requests and Blockers Tracker Leverage this sheet in the Fin Success Planner to track all feature requests, escalations and blockers requested by the customer. See here for Fin Success Planner


### Stage 2: Readiness


If your 40/40 customer is dormant please see Initial Scoping Section otherwise see below:


### Configure Basic Fin Settings


Objective: Ensure the Fin is properly configured, all features are accurately set up, and a custom report is created to identify potential optimization opportunities.

Steps Details Resources Ask customer to add you as a Teammate in their workspace Ask the customer to add you as a teammate in their workspace with full admin access so you can read critical data (ie content and conversations) to continue to identify areas for opportunity. Sign up with your @intercom email address so that the seat is automatically removed from their bill using this FF - they will not be charged for it. Sample framing Message: Hey team, As we continue to make optimization to Fin we will be able to progress faster if you add me [insert email] as a teammate to your workspace. You won’t be charged for this seat and we won't make any changes to your account before informing you. Ensure all relevant features are enabled correctly Check current Fin Features as a way to identify other opportunities to set Fin up properly. Full list of Fin Features here Check for relevant alphas or betas Check the Status column of this table for a list of Betas you could opt customers in to Full list of Betas across R&D here Review existing Fin set up Follow the steps outlined on the Fin Optimization Guide in the Fin Success Planner: Recommended that you opt all customers into Guidance - Opt-in Process See here for Fin Success Planner Review Fins Personality & Add Guidance Follow the steps outlined on the Fin Optimization Guide in the Fin Success Planner: Set up the Tone of Voice Update to make Fin's replies sound more like customers preferred tone, Link in Product: Here How to find: AI & Automation > Fin AI Agent > Personality and select Fin's tone of voice. Set up the Fin Guidance. Enable Guidance to provide Fin with custom instructions to ensure it always follows the correct support policies Link in Product: Here How to find: AI & Automation > Fin AI Agent > Guidance. Note: this has been hugely impactful for positive end user engagement with Fin. Guidance: See here for best practices and examples See here for additional customer examples (please add more as you come across them) Optimize Fin Welcome Messages Follow the steps outlined on the Fin Optimization Guide in the Fin Success Planner: Ensure that the customer has created a Fin Introduction message across all channels and touchpoints that helps their customers better understand what Fin can do and how to interact with it. Note: Again this is impactful for positive end user engagement with Fin. See here  for good examples of Welcome Messages in (please add more as you come across them) Set up Multilingual Support Check if non-English languages are enabled as Supported Languages in the app. Check if they have enabled these languages as Supported Languages in the app Check with customers if they have content in all languages. If they have some content, check if that content should only be available to users who speak that language (if so, enable audience targeting) If they don't, enable real-time translations Link in Product: Here How to find: Settings> Fin AI Agent > Multilingual Support Set up Custom Report for Optimisation In lieu of the AI Insights product or any data in the Content Gaps report, create a custom report to identify what can be improved in their current setup. See example report. You’re essentially looking for opportunities to: Add more content or improve existing content Add actions Add data for personalised actions Add guidance where Fin requires some additional context to get the answer right Improve how Fin is setup (e.g. workflows) to create a smoother experience Fin Channels, i.e. Fin over email Look for opportunities to expand your customers’ AI strategy to channels beyond Messenger. Start by reviewing their current channel mix and gauging the company’s current stance on expanding their Fin strategy. Are they considering using Fin on email? Other channels? Ex: “This is the current state of your AI strategy [insert overview of additional CSM context]. We see you have had success implementing Fin on Messenger and that you have a high volume of email. Because of this, we believe email could be another accelerator of your AI strategy.” Where appropriate, reinforce Fin as a tool that will continue to support their business goals and tie back to their wider AI strategy. Highlight how they could extract more value with Fin over email. Outline the steps needed to get Fin over email live for their customers. Provide tangible, bite-sized next steps that maintain accountability and timelines. Note: If any blocker or technical hurdle, please let R&D know using #fin-over-email-adoption slack channel. Internal set-up guidance External, shareable set-up guidance


### Stage 3: Optimization



### Knowledge Analysis & Optimization


Objective: Identify content gaps, assess quality for AI and connect additional sources to increase Fin's ability to answer informational questions.

Activity Steps How to Resources Configuration Check all content that could be enabled for Fin is enabled for Fin Do this in the Workspace: Link in Product: Here How to find: Open Knowledge Hub -> Sources -> AI Agent Do this in the product or in Admin tools: Link in Product: Here How to find: Open Admin tools -> Knowledge -> Content Usage Summary -> Admin tool If the customer uses Multi Brand or Multi Help Center, check that it’s been configured correctly Check that the content is enabled for the correct audiences. Link in Product: Here How to find: Open Admin tools -> xx -> xx -> Admin tool Knowledge Analysis Review Content for AI Readiness Note: Content Performance Report is on the top right of the Knowledge Hub and the specific table you are looking for is at the bottom of the report Link in Product: Here How to find: Open Knowledge Hnb ->Content Performance -> View Content Performance-> Content performance Details: Go to the Content Performance table at the bottom of the Content Performance Report (currently in Legacy Report through new AI Agent report) -> Sort by Times Used in Answers. Focus on reviewing the content in the top 35-40 results as a starting point. Use our best-practice guide to evaluate AI Readiness. Best practice Guide for AI Content See here for prompts to get started. Check the quality of their synced sources Link in Product: Here How to find: n/a Details: Every website is different and therefore the webscraper sometimes struggles to sync everything correctly. Start by manually eyeballing content on the website and cross-reference it with what’s been synced in Intercom. Assume they’re missing content and URL’s, as it’s likely they are. If you notice missing content you can add sub URLs to the Website sync by following these steps: Open Knowledge Hub -> Sources -> Websites -> Manage -> Open Settings -> Additional URLs -> Save & Resync Check web for other publicly available content to sync for Fin Link in Product: Here How to find: n/a Details: Google the company name + key words like “docs” and “university/education” to find other useful sources of content they might not have thought about syncing. If a customer has a high level of video content, we can import this via our AI Content API. If you find a source to sync, follow these steps: Open Knowledge Hub -> Sources -> Websites -> Sync -> Add URL -> Save Content Gap Analysis Note: this is very manual but (for now) it is the best way to build a sense of missing content by reviewing unresolved informational conversations aka those routed to a human agent from Fin Details: Pull a list of ~30 unresolved informational Conversations (Go to FinSights Drive Folder >Taxonomy Sample Conversations > Unresolved Conversations sheet.) into the Fin Unresolved Conversations Analysis table Read the conversation and determine what the core customer question was Use the Test Fin feature to compare Fin Unresolved Conversations Analysis table Teammate answer with Fin answer Capture Content/Action suggestion in the sheet The big benefit of doing this manually is that you’ll start to build a strong sense of; The customer’s content, The language their customer use which is helpful for writing new content, Guidance that should help Fin. Drive Folder with Automated FinSights Resolved and Unresolved Conversations See here for Fin Unresolved Conversations Analysis table Knowledge Development Work with Customer to get their content AI ready For Public Articles:
Use our guide on Optimising Content for Fin and an Enterprise ChatGPT account to reformat content. -> See here for prompts to get started. For Snippets:
Best practice for snippets is to format them as Question and Answer. Enable Content from Conversations Beta Link in Product: Here How to find: Open Settings -> Additional URLs -> Save & Resync AI & Automations -> Setup -> Content -> Content from Conversations Monitor and improve over time (optional) Weekly QA of unresolved conversations Drill into the ‘Fin Success Custom Report’ and review individual conversations through the UI to build context as to what went wrong. Grab the CID and place it into the Fin AI Agent Conversation Analysis sheet within the Fin Success Planner and document your commentary. Take action based on why Fin couldn't answer these questions to refine performance and answer quality. Flag that this custom report is available to customers and that they can spot check individual conversations here also. See here for Fin Weekly QA sheet (optional) Weekly analysis of low CSAT conversations Once Fin is live, pull the list of conversations with a CSAT of 1, 2, and 3 and review/categorise them (choose multiple): missing content, missing guidance, poor AI answer quality, required action, good AI answer, mistrust of AI answer Grab the CID and place it into the Poor CSAT Analysis within the Fin Success Planner and document your commentary. Take action based on why Fin couldn't answer these questions to refine performance and answer quality Link in Product: Here How to find: AI Agent Report -> Fin AI agent conversation ratings - by conversation rating -> Drill into poor CSAT conversations See here for Poor CSAT Analysis


### Workflows Analysis and Optimization


Objective: Understand customer workflows orchestration and where best to place Fin.

Activity How to Resources Review Fin Workflows Review Overview report to get an understanding of high level volume splits. Filter by > Channel > Review the reporting selecting each of the channels one by one, looking for differences Start with the reporting drill ins on categories where conversations are seemingly being routed away from Fin, and Then trace to the workflow which acted on those conversations to see if a tag is being applied. Then filter by that tag for the rest of the analysis to exclude those conversations. Drill-in to Review human routed conversation to see if there is an automation/tag being applied that applies to a specific kind of business process (e.g: notifications from other systems forwarded to Intercom conversations) and then filter out conversations from that tag to get to the "real" Involvement Rate metrics Review individual workflows to see how close to the beginning the Fin step is Provide clear guidance on how to orchestrate Fin for the evaluation process, which for most cases is through a new, Fin-first Workflow. Check if they are using the simple setup, Profiles, and/or Custom Answers – these complicate things further. See here for Loom video instructions See here for EMEA training on Fin Workflows See here for additional guidance on Analysing fin Workflows Monitor and improve over time Review Fin Conversations to ensure Fin is getting involved at the right point in the conversation.


### Actions Analysis and Development


Objective: Map out use cases for actions, build Fin Workflows and Actions to increase Fin's ability to answer all personalized and Tasks based questions.

Activity Steps How to Resources Actions Analysis Generate AI Actions Recommendations Go to the Admin Tool linked in Resources and enter the app ID This will analyse recent conversations where actions were taken and generate a list of Action suggestions. It might take up to 30 minutes to run. Download the table and do a light analysis to check that these actions make sense. Remove any duplicates. Go to the Actions Matrix in the Finsights Deck and plot the action recommendations in the corresponding part of the matrix. Once you’ve completed this step you can ask an SE to sense check your analysis if you’re unsure. Last, validate that these actions resonate with the customer. This is a jumping off point for a bigger discussion about sequencing and creating actions. Go here for AI Actions Recommendations Admin Tool Actions Discovery Call Once you have done your own actions analysis (see above), request an Actions Discovery call with the customer to map out the top 2-3 actions use cases together. This call should be booked for 1 hour and both an SE and someone technical on the customers’ side should attend. At the start of the call, align on the highest volume and preferred Actions to set up first Then, map out these Actions on a shared Miro board. This is so that you understand and capture all steps of the Action use case end to end. Important to identify the API endpoints required on their side to get these Actions set up. Once you have these mapped out in Miro, let the customer know that you’re going to mock those up in a Workflow and share with them async to validate. Important: the customer needs to have the API endpoints available on their side to actually go live. Sometimes there may be a bit of back and forth between their engineers and ours required to get these set up. Example calls: Example 1 Example 2 Actions Development Mock up and validate Workflows with the Actions Use your demo workspace to mock up Actions and Workflows. Send these to the customer in a shared Slack channel to validate the flow. Refine as necessary until the customer is happy that they are correct. See here for examples and use cases for Fin Actions - Must be signed in. Create and test Fin Actions Once the end points have been created, create Fin Actions in Settings -> Actions. Test the Action by setting the audience to be internal test accounts, such as @x-comapny email address. If the results look good, test the Fin Action with a small cohort of customers. Create Fin Actions: Test then go Live Once aligned on the mocks and the end points have been created you have two options: If the customer is highly technical they can create these Actions and Workflows themselves. If not, arrange a follow up call to set up the Actions and Workflows together. Invite an SE to do this with you. Create Fin Actions in Settings -> Actions Test the Action by setting the audience to be internal test accounts, such as @x-comapny email address, If the results look good, test the Fin Action with a small cohort of customers, Once the results are good, remove all targeting and go live Weekly analysis of unresolved Actions conversations Coming soon Weekly analysis of low CSAT for Actions conversations Coming soon


### Stage 4: Ongoing Success



### Coming Soon



### Appendix



### Initial Scoping


Objective: Develop a clear opinion, with buy-in from the customer, on the right approach for initial Fin deployment and a shared evaluation criteria for measuring initial performance.

Steps Details Resources Request impersonation permissions (if relevant) Request impersonation rights to the customer so we can act on their account on their behalf. This can be done through a Slack message Sample Slack Message: Hey team, As we start working on preparing to deploy Fin, we’ll be able to progress faster if you give us impersonation rights to your account. We won't make any changes to your account before informing you, and all changes we make that impact live traffic will be confirmed with you first. Can you please go to this page and give us access to your account? Align on initial Fin involvement Align with customers on which conversations Fin should be involved in as early as possible. It's important that we are opinionated on approach and base it off the customer's highest likelihood of success with Fin. Sometimes the ideal set-up is to deploy Fin to all conversations. To do so, customers need to have great content and be willing to invest in actions (if required by their conversation taxonomy). In most cases, customers are hesitant and will prefer to roll Fin out to a specific topic, language, demographic, percentage of conversations, out-of-hours, etc. example: Align on initial duration Align with customers on how long Fin is live for the initial evaluation. You want a time-bound commitment in which you will get enough conversations through that statistically represent the totality of conversations Fin will get involved in Avoid turning Fin on and off multiple times as most of the time it doesn't give you enough time to properly evaluate As a rule of thumb, the ideal commitment is at least 2 weeks. The Data Science team should vet the time period to ensure we will get enough examples to understand Fin's performance. example: Set up Evaluation Sheet Automated: coming very soon (data science team) Manual: Work with the customer to identify a sample of ~50 qualitative distributed questions which can be used to evaluate Fins answers. This list of questions should contain: Conversation ID Customer query Topic Ideal Human Answer Fin Answer (empty column for now) Initially, the Ideal Human Response should be populated with the first response from agents on sample conversations. You should request the customer to validate all the Ideal Human Responses and tweak accordingly to their preferences. Swarm Deployment Evaluation Sheet - Template Identify content, data and actions needed to achieve Fin success Begin planning for the work needed to get Fin in a good state. Things to think about: What content needs to be added for the informational queries What data is needed for personalised answers What actions need building out, and the needs between Fin Actions or Fin Workflows. Map out existing workflows to understand what is the right orchestration set up for Fin. For this step you will need to revisit conversation taxonomy and topics to identify areas with largest automation potential given the list of questions defined for Evaluation. Example: CSM Scorecard. // need examples of best practice for FIn first workflows & objection handling, give examples of where this went badly, ie Holafly and Underdog

Good job - Now you’re ready to set Fin live - See xx Section above.


### Knowledge Analysis & Optimization



### additional step for Dormant Customers


Objective: Identify content gaps, assess quality for AI and connect additional sources to increase Fin's ability to answer informational questions.

Activity Steps How to Resources Knowledge Analysis Content Gap Analysis Note: Unfortunately this is very manual but (for now) it is the best way to build a sense of missing content. For Non Fin Existing Customers: Pull a sheet of Informational conversations (ask RAD for now) Use the Conversation ID to search for it in Admin Tools Scan the conversation and determine what the core customer question was Copy/paste the teammate answer into the original sheet Then click the “Test Fin” link above the core customer question and copy/paste Fin’s answer into the sheet Compare the teammate's answer with Fin’s answer and create a content suggestion if relevant. The big benefit of doing this manually is that you’ll start to build a strong sense of; The customer’s content, The language their customer use which is helpful for writing new content, Guidance that should help Fin. To-do: Loom video

Ongoing Success Notes:

How do we show a customer that they have made the right progress after the first 3 months since kick off? and therefore, continue to see Intercom as the vendor of choice.

What should be on the deck that we show customers when in ongoing success? Repurpose part of the kick off deck to show progress ?

How we help our customers navigate the change management of moving to AI e.g. In the beginning we will find the early adopters will take this on whilst other customers will need more convincing and direction. Do we need to have a section on this in the Ongoing Success section?

E.g we know that if a customer assigns an internal owner of Fin they are more likely going to be successful. We need to ensure this is part of the ongoing success.

Suggestion:


### QA Fin Conversations at Scale


How best to implement a solid QA process for Fin and suggest this to customers to ensure Fin processes scale.

Manual conversation tagging is time consuming - what can we do to bridge this gap?

Knowing how to change the answers Fin gives. A lot of time reviewing if Fin is correct.
