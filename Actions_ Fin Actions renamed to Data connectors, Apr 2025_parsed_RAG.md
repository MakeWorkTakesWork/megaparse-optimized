### # 4 types of support use cases



### Informational answers are the same for everyone.


Personalized questions might be common, but the answer is dynamic because it uses live or customer specific data.

Example: - Whatʼs in the basic plan? - Do you ship to the UK?


### Example: - How much was my last bill? - Whereʼs my order?



### Fin can do this with Knowledge



### Fin can do this with Data connectors (previously Actions)


Actions need an update in an external system to be performed for the customer


### Example: - Can I cancel my order? - I need to pause my plan



### Fin can now do this with Tasks


Troubleshooting can involve asking diagnostic questions, inspecting the product instance, or looking up data.

Example: - I canʼt log into my account - My router is offline


### Fin can now do this with Tasks

### Key Messages: How to talk to customers about this?


Are any of my settings and functionalities changing? No changes to current functionality. Customers can continue using Data connectors (previously Actions) as they do today. Actions will be simply be renamed to Data connectors.

Where do I find Actions/Data connectors? Data connectors (previously Actions) can be accessed by navigating to Settings>Integrations>Data connectors

What happened to Fin Actions? Fin Actions are simply the ability for Fin to generate personalized answers using Data connectors (previously Actions). Customers can still use Data connectors to enable Fin to generate Personalized answers. To enable Fin to resolve more complex, action-based requests like refunds, cancellations and account changes, customers should use Fin Tasks, which will be in open beta soon.
