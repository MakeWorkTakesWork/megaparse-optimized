## OVERVIEW



### What are Value Drivers?


Value drivers are the critical business needs that motivate prospects to seek solutions and reallocate resources:


### Prospect is likely proactively looking for or needing.



### Generally revenue, cost, or risk related.


Top-of-mind customer topics that exist even if Intercom doesn’t.


### Cause a buyer to re-allocate discretionary funds.


Support a value-based conversation (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive).

We explain these drivers in the following structure:


### The Before Scenario, and the Negative Consequences of it.


The After Scenario, and the Positive Business Outcomes from it.

The Required Capabilities, and the Metrics to prove success.


### How Intercom Does It, and how we do it Better.



### Proof Points, such as customer references and case studies


Discovery Questions, to determine what is driving the customer’s decision-making.


### What are Differentiators?


They can influence a buyer's decision criteria through Required Capabilities.

Each Differentiator contains a Description, Customer Value, Defensibility and Trap-Setting.

There are 3 types:

Unique – Not available from any other vendor. These are leading products or services that only Intercom can provide.

Comparative – Superior attributes when compared to other companies, often feature or service-based.

Holistic – Attributes of Intercom that would make a customer feel good about doing business with us.

We explain the Differentiators using:

The Differentiator itself (such as Category Leading AI Agent).


### Its value to the customer (in revenue, cost, and risk).


Its defensibility, similar to Proof Points, our customer’s point-of-view.

Trap-Setting Questions; the topics you’ll want to bring up to drive prospects to the Differentiator.


### What are Trap-Setting Questions?


Trap-Setting Questions allow us to demonstrate how our solutions are better and different from the competition. They help us steer a discovery conversation toward our differentiators by being trusted advisors. We call them "trap setting" because they trap our competition. They highlight the value that a customer will receive with Intercom and the components they won't have if they choose a competitor.

Fin is the category-leading AI agent, recognised for its unmatched performance and 99.9% accuracy. Powered by the Intercom AI Engine™, it resolves up to 86% of queries and delivers 54% right away. Fin leads across key industries: Fintech, eCommerce, eGaming & Gambling, and Software & Technology (SaaS), delivering personalised support that scales with your business.

Fin is able to maintain a conversational flow by asking clarifying questions and taking actions for customers across third party systems. Zendesk's bot lacks these abilities, giving a default reply when it can't answer. This means Fin will always answer more complex questions than Zendesk. And it's why Fin wins on answer quality metrics like completeness, helpfulness, clarity, and readability.
