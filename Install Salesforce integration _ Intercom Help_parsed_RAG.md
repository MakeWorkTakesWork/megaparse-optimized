The Salesforce app creates a seamless connection with Intercom. Your marketing team can
send targeted outbound campaigns using Salesforce data and can automatically create new
leads in Salestorce when they're captured on your website. Your sales and support team will
have complete context of who they're chatting with by seeing in-depth Salestorce data
alongside conversations, which can be routed to the right teammate, automatically.

The Salestorce app in Intercom enables your teams to:

Keep your CRM up-to-date by automatically creating new leads in Salesforce when
they're captured in Intercom and sync data and conversations.

Get leads and customers to the right teammate, faster, by automatically routing them to
their account owners or the right sales or support team.

Reduce tab switching by viewing information from Salestorce on leads and customers
right inside the Intercom inbox: see the status of leads, their owner, key account and
contact details, opportunity stage and value, close dates and more.

Send targeted campaigns by using Salestorce data to segment and filter audiences for
your outbound messages.

## Install Salesforce integration Intercom Help



### [Image: unknown]

### Intercom


Recommended reading: This article explains exactly how and when data is synced
between Salesforce and Intercom. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself before you
configure your attribute mapping.

At present it is not possible to map and sync Tags or Events via the App. However, as a
workaround, the data returned via certain Webhook topics (e.g. contaclusertaggreated
could used to update Salesforce - this would require developer k7owledge/fesources to
implement.


### How does mapping Leads and Users work?


A mapping is established when objects (leads or users) with the same identifier (fields such as
a customer number or email address) are found both in Intercom and in Salesforce.

If duplicate objects exist, Intercom Users will be prioritized over Intercom Leads. In Salesforce,
Contacts will be prioritized over Leads. In a case with two matching users or two matching
leads, the last updated one will be matched.

For example, a user in Intercom with the user_id 'abc123' will be matched with a contact in
Salesforce with the customer number 'abc123!.

You must use email address to map leads as they do not have a user_id.


### # How does mapping attributes work?


After mapping objects (leads and users), you can map and sync their attributes (fields). You can
also determine in which direction the attribute will be sent during the sync process (from
Intercom to Salestorce or Salestorce to Intercom).


### <


Data synced via these mappings is applied directly to the user, lead or contact in
Salesforce or Intercom, for a simple view of live Salesforce data in Intercom, use the
Inbox app.

In order to sync attributes between Intercom and Salesforce, their data types need to be
compatible between both systems. The following tables show the types of attributes that can 0S
be synced between Intercom and Salesforce:

Once you configure the mapping of leads or users and their attributes, Intercom will
automatically keep attributes in sync as they change in either system.

When syncing a Reference type from Salesforce to Intercom, the synced value will be the
Reference ID and not the value that it is referring to.


## 0S



### 00


Data isn't synced immediately, you may notice a delay of up to 5 minutes.


### # Special cases


Formula fields:

Formula fields are more complex and the syncing behaviour can depend on the Salestorce
setup. In general formula fields can be mapped and synced to Intercom. However because
this field is calculated, changes to this field will not initiate a trigger meaning that this field
will only be synced when something else triggers the sync.

High frequency fields:
Intercom attributes that have a very high rate/trequency of change e.g. last_seen are not
currently mappable. This ens su n res API allocations are not overly used by Intercom.

UTM Parameters:
Mapping UTM parameter attributes from Intercom to Salestorce is only supported for
Salestorce Leads, not Contacts.

options:

1. Map using a unique identifier (with User ID in Intercom). This is the recommended option.


### 2. Map using email address.

This option requires you to have a unique customer-defined ID that is set in both Intercom and

and Salestorce.

Our current implementation of CRT only uses the configuration linked to the user profile

configuration regardless of their Salesforce profile.

In Salesforce, the case fields are split into different sections. To minimise space in the
Inbox, we've opted to remove the section grouping.

The current implementation doesn't support default formulas.

There is currently no field validation when creating a case. For example, if the Case field in
Salesforce only accepts numbers teammates can still enter string values. Case creation
will fail in this scenario.

If case creation fails, the teammate will receive an error message.
