Fin for Zendesk & Fin for Salesforce | Product Messaging Guide

Owner: Fergal Cullen Tatiana Bassil| Last updated: Feb 3, 2025 | Status:

PLEASE READ BEFORE SCROLLING Who is this for? This is for prospects. This is not existing Intercom platform customers. For customers interested in Fin, see the Fin 2 messaging guide for details. How should I use this doc? This doc covers the messaging, features, benefits specific to Fin for platforms → The below are meant to be complementary to our core Fin 2 message, features, benefits. Make sure that the audience you’re talking to has the Fin 2 context before jumping into the highlighted benefits. If you are introducing Fin to a prospect for the first time, make sure to talk about Fin’s capabilities and why it is the best performing in the industry, and then you can speak to the below benefits of using it with another platform.


### What is Fin vs Fin 2 vs Fin standalone?



### Fin AI Agent is our one and only AI agent product.


It is a sophisticated product that is deeply connected to the Intercom platform, leveraging tools and capabilities (Knowledge, Workflows, Reporting, Data & Integrations) that make it the most advanced AI agent in the world.

Fin 2 is the 2nd generation of Fin AI Agent, as defined by its latest set of capabilities across knowledge, behavior, actions, insights.


### Fin 2 is not a new/different product



### Fin 2 = Fin AI agent


Fin standalone is an internal term we use to describe the latest way for customers who are using other CS platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce to purchase Fin, without having to switch customer support platforms.


### We SHOULD NOT use the term Fin standalone externally!



### What is our ‘Fin standalone’ naming?


Status:

The external name we use should communicate that the product is still the same - Fin AI Agent. But it is available with a different platform. When speaking to customers with context, we will use the following names:


### Fin for platforms



### Fin for Zendesk



## Fin for Salesforce / Fin for Service Cloud



### When to talk about Fin AI Agent vs Fin for [platform]?


Fin for Zendesk and Fin for Salesforce is an additional way to buy Fin AI Agent and includes all of the latest Fin 2 features & capabilities.

Fin AI Agent: If you're talking about Fin AI Agent features and capabilities or to an existing Intercom platform customer please refer to the Fin 2 messaging guide

Fin for [platform]: if your you’re talking about Fin on any given platform please see below


### Our target customer


Support leaders who are keen to improve their customer experience and operations but are either unable (locked into contracts) or unwilling to switch due to the risk (technical, training, system downtime, etc.) or pain associated with migrating a system that took years to build in terms of processes and workflows etc.

The core insight is directionally right, but not fully fleshed out.

Original Insight: "Our audience doesn't understand what Fin, as an AI agent, unlocks for their business."

This is correct — even sophisticated buyers are still learning what a great AI agent can really do. However, the two core pain points identified to support this insight fall short:

"They don't understand the category” – This oversimplifies the sophistication of many buyers and doesn't acknowledge that they're actively comparing solutions.

"They feel pressure to stay competitive and know AI is critical" – While true, this speaks to why they're looking into AI, not what's holding them back from choosing Fin.

We should double down on sophisticated, high-volume buyers who are actively seeking a solution. This ties into our company strategy. Winning the high-value, high-readiness segment — and using their success to influence the rest.

Sharper Insight: Buyers are skeptical from experience. They've seen generic bots and overhyped, underwhelming AI solutions. What they need is clarity on how Fin is different — and real proof that Fin is the real deal.


### Our best-fit buyers already understand the value of AI.


They are actively evaluating solutions and are far more sophisticated than the messaging assumes.

What they lack is trust that a solution exists which can truly deliver at scale, with quality and control.


### More distinct messaging across the funnel


Fin is the category leader and the messaging should reflect that with Bold claims “Fin is the #1 AI Agent in Customer Service.”, clear differentiators as to why Fin is better and strong proof “Trusted by the best and the most — companies like [X, Y, Z].”
