### # Who is a good fit


1. Key customer segments that are most likely to benefit from Fin Tasks

Very high-volume customers with a meaningful % of action-Dased
requests

Medium-to-high volume with a high % of action-based requests

Al-forward companies ready to automate beyond FAQs e.g. Clay


### 2. Checklist: Is your customer ready for Fin Tasks?


Do they have repetitive, high-impact workflows handled by agents?

o Start by identifying 1-2 workflows where automation could meaningfully
reduce support volume. Look for repeatable processes that currently rely
on human intervention.


### For existing customers


Your Intercom Overview report is a great place to spot trends
and uncover common issues being routed to your team.

Assess opportunities and their query volume breakdown by
asking for analysis in #auromated-finsignts

Evaluate existing Workflows and custom answers that may
be good candidates for Fin Tasks.

Consider starting from lower risk workflows where the
customer would be comfortable to try things out


### For prospects



### Assess their query volume breakdown in discovery


Research their business and website to understand potential
support requests that may be action-based

Can they provide API access or are open to doing sO with support?
o Many Tasks rely on APIs to fetch or update data- -know which ones are
needed, their outputs, and how they'l! be used.

Do they have cross-functional support from product or eng as needed?

Task setup often needs input from product, engineering, or ops especially
for new or updated APIs. Clear workflow alignment ensures the right
systems are in place.

Are they open to testing and iteration while setting up a Fin Task?

### # Understanding Customer Motivations (Before Scenarios)


Example customer quotes:


### "We're getting bogged down in repetitive tasks."


"Our agents are spending too much time on actions, not just answers.

"We want to automate more, but we're not sure where to start."

"We're exploring ways to operationalize Al beyond just chatbots."


### 1. Manual Human Involvement


Complex support requests like refunds, identity checks, or troubleshooting required human
agents.

Teams were bogged down by repetitive, high-effort tasks, reducing their time for
higher-value work.


### 2. Rigid Automation Tools


Traditional automation solutions (like workflows) were hard to scale and maintain.

These tools required detailed decision trees and manual setup, making them brittle and
inflexible for evolving support scenarios.


### 3. Poor Customer Experience



### End users had to navigate confusing menus and buttons.


Customer interactions were not conversational, often relying on form-filling and static UI
components.


### 4. Limited Al Capability



### Most Al agents handled only simple, informational queries.


They failed on multi-step processes or returned unreliable results when trying to act
beyond their scope.


### 5. Inconsistent Support


Manual execution led to variability in how requests were handled.

There was limited control and oversight, leading to possible errors or inconsistent
outcomes.

help using the 'get help' option when on the Fin Tasks page, starter templates, including
third party templates for Shopify, Statuspage and Stripe that can be repurposed for
CC on mmor n use cases. We also have Al generated task instructions where customers can get
help to generate the right prompts.


### # 2. Control Over Automation


Before Scenario: Inconsistent Support - Manual execution led to variability in how requests
were handled. There was limited control and oversight, leading to possible errors or
inconsistent outcomes.

Key ICP: ICP B. Large enterprises with substantial customer interactions and a signiticant
workforce will prioritize control and accuracy in automation to avoid errors that could impact
their large-scale operations.

Objection: "We need to ensure that automation doesn't lead to errors.

Response: Highlight that Fin Tasks allow for a high level of control and reliability. Customers
can define specific business rules and conditions, ensuring that Fin operates within their
guidelines and reduces the risk of errors. Showcase testing and preview capabilities for Fin
Tasks and also how customers will be able to see what actions Fin is taking to diagnose and
understand errors.


### # 3. Integration with Existing Systems


Before Scenario: Limited Al Capability - Most Al agents handled only simple, informational
queries. They failed on multi-step processes or returned unreliable results when trying to act
beyond their scope.

Key ICP: ICP A. High-profile companies that influence the market will be particularly
concerned about seamless integration with their existing sophisticated systems to maintain
operational efficiency and avoid disruptions.

Objection: "Will Fin Tasks integrate well with our current systems?"

repetitive, high-effort tasks, reducing their time for higher-value work.

Key ICP: ICP D. Smaller companies with signiticant but manageable conversation volumes
are more likely to be sensitive to additional costs, especially if they are in the growth phase
and managing tight budgets.


### Objection: "Is this going to be an additional cost?"


Response: Clarify that during the closed beta phase, Fin Tasks are available at no additional
cost to existing Fin customers. This allows them to explore the benefits without financial
commitment.


### # 5. Effectiveness Compared to Traditional Workflows


Before Scenario: Rigid Automation Tools - Traditional automation solutions (like workflows)
were hard to scale and maintain. These tools required detailed decision trees and manual
setup, making them brittle and inflexible for evolving support scenarios.

Key ICP: ICP C. Mid-sized companies that have invested in traditional workflows may be
skeptical about switching to a new system and will need convincing evidence of the
benefits and improvements offered by Fin Tasks.

Objection: "How do Fin Tasks compare to our current workflows?"

Response: Explain that while traditional workflows work well for many complex processes,
they need to start with hard-coded trigger messages, can get increasingly complex and
hard to maintain as the business grows. They also involve the use of menus, buttons, forms
for end customers which means that while the informational side of support is
conversational with Fin, the action based side of support is still clunky and old school,
creating an inconsistent end customer experience, Fin Tasks are designed for complex,
multi-step processes and bring together the best of both worlds: the efficiency and
conversational nature of Al and the control and reliability of hard-coded workflows.


### # 6. Uncertainty About Al Reliability


Before Scenario: Inconsistent Support = Manual execution led to variability in how requests
were handled. There was limited control and oversight, leading to possible errors or
inconsistent outcomes.

Key ICP: ICP B. Large enterprises handling sensitive and high-stakes customer interactions
will be particularly concerned about the reliability and trustworthiness of Al solutions to
ensure they meet their stringent operational standards.


### Objection: "Can we trust Al to handle sensitive tasks?"


Response: Address this concern by discussing the built-in safeguards that allow for identity
veritication and the ability to review and approve actions before they are executed.
Customers can add hard-coded steps to take the guesswork out of how the Task will be
