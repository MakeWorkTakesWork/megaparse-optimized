### Table of contents


Keep your Salesforce articles in sync with your Intercom Help Center and use them to
power Fin.

# Important:


## You'll still keep your Help Center website on Salesforce.


Only published Salesforce articles are synced. They must either be public or visible to
logged-in users. Any articles that have other audience targeting rules applied to them
in Salesforce won't be synced.

Once the sync is complete, articles will be accessible in the Content section.


### # Get started


Once you have your Salesforce API connected, you can start a sync from Train > Content
by clicking Import/sync knowledge base from Salesforce.

# Sync conter n from your Salesforce Help Center Fin by Intercom: Help Center

Public Articles that are synced from Salesforce will be shown as view-only and can't be
edited. All changes must be made through Salesforce and will automatically propagate to
Intercom with the next sync. However, you can configure the settings for synced articles
such as enabling them for Fin or managing audience rules through the Details panel on the
right.


### [Image: unknown]



### <


# Note:

Re-syncs automatically run every hour and propagate any changes made to
articles in Salesforce into Intercom. This includes new articles, article content
changes, and removing articles.

Syncs that run automatically following the first sync won't send an email on
completion.

Sync conte n from your Salesforce Help Center Fin by Intercom: Help Center

There are slight differences with how synced articles look in the Messenger compared
to Intercom articles. Differences can include content formats such as, additional
headings, text styling, table formatting, etc.

If a customer clicks the "Open in Help Center" link at the bottom of a synced article in
the Messenger, this will open a new tab with the article in your Salesforce Help Center.

Synced articles and collections are read-only and can't be edited or moved from and
to collections from Intercom Articles or via the Public API. All changes must be made
through Salestorce and will automatically propagate to Intercom with the next sync.

We don't support articles that are in any language that is not currently supported by
Intercom. If you only have one English language supported, this will be transferred to
the Intercom "default English" instead of the regional English language mapped in
Salestorce.


### <

We only support 2 levels of article nesting; collections and sections. Any Salesforce
articles in multi-nested sections will be collapsed into the second level.

We don't support the styles on articles that are set at a theme level on Salesforce SO
there may be differences between how an article looks in Salestorce VS. Intercom.

Internai/private knowledge base is not supported by the sync as they're not public
articles.

We exclusively support videos added through Salesforces 'Add video' button, typically
embedded via iframe, and compatible with all providers available in Salesforce's article 3
editor (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, JWPlayer, Brightcove, Vidyard, Loom, Guidde). 05 00
Custom HTML, CSS, or Javascript-Dased video embeds are not supported.

### # Remove the sync


If you'd like to remove the sync with Salesforce (and related data), you can do this from
Train > Content by clicking Manage > Remove this source under public articles.

You'll see a green confirmation banner indicating the removal has been successful and
synced articles will be deleted from the Knowledge Hub in Intercom.
