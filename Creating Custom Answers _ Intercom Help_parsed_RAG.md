### Table of contents


Custom Answers allow you to build bespoke answers to the most important questions for
increased accuracy, consistency, and specificity and when you want to create answers that
include rich media, Data connectors, Custom Objects and/or Custom Apps.

Fin can then use these Custom Answers to resolve specific questions a customer asks at the
start of a new conversation, and Fin will prioritize them over its Al answers.

Note: Custom Answers are unavailable for customers who joined Intercom on or after
March 19, 2025. Instead, you can use Fin Tasks. Customers with existing Custom
Answers can continue using them for now.


### # Get started


To create a Custom Answer for Fin, go to Fin AlAgent > Train > Custom Answers and click
New answer.

There is an upper-limit of 30 non-stop words a question can have (stop words are things
like "it", "the", they", "what", etc.). If a query is longer than this, Fin Al Agent will not send
Custom Answers, as it is likely too complex for a Custom Answer to solve.

### # Add qualifiers to specify your questions even more


If you'd like a Custom Answer to send only when specific words are used in the question, use
qualifiers. This can come in handy when you have similar answers for different parts of the
system/product. It will help you define which word has to be mentioned in the question
exactly, to get the right custom answer.

By adding them, the answer will only send for questions that contain those words, and not for
any similar questions without them.

The presence of qualitiers in a question doesn't guarantee an answer will send.

### # Creating Custom Answers Intercom Help


A Custom Answer must be set live for Fin to be able to use it.

Fin will first respond with Custom Answers if there's a strong match. Otherwise, it
will generate its own Al answer (if Al answers are enabled).

When Fin Al Agent is configured to use both Custom Answers and Al answers, if a
customer sends multiple messages that would trigger the same Custom Answer, the
Custom Answer is only sent the first time it matches. Subsequent times where the
Custom Answer matches in this conversation, the Custom Answer won't be sent
again, an Al answer will be sent instead. This is to avoid customers being stuck
getting the samne answer for their problem after asking multiple times.


### # Customer experience


If a customer clicks That heLped or if they don't reply within three minutes, Fin Al Agent will
close the conversation. If they'd like to see another answer, they can click Get more help

### [Image: unknown]


Depending on how you've configured your Custom Answer workflow, it can either explain
where to get more help, or hand over to a teammate.

# Note:

Fin will only show the Show me more option if you've created multiple answers that

Because Custom Answers offer a chance to talk to the team, they will likely drive
more conversations to your inbox without allowing Fin to use Al answers.
