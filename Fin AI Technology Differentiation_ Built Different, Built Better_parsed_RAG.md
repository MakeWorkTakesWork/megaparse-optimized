Fin AI Architecture: Built for Precision, Optimized for Speed

Fin isn’t just AI for customer service—it’s AI built for customer service. Every layer of its architecture is designed to deliver what support teams actually need: fast, accurate answers, consistent resolution, full control, and the ability to scale effortlessly.

We group our advantages into three key areas:

Performance & Precision – AI technology designed for best-in-class answers, faster and more reliably

Control & Complexity – Capabilities that enable customization, compliance, and workflow power

Execution & Scale – Global scale powering enterprise-grade performance and results


### Performance & Precision


Fin delivers the highest-quality answers in customer service—because it’s built differently. From how we retrieve knowledge to how we validate responses, every layer of our AI engine is optimized to resolve complex issues with speed, accuracy, and consistency.


### Purpose-Built Retrieval


Most AI agents rely on generic search and keyword matching. Fin doesn’t. It uses a custom-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, designed specifically for support content. That means Fin doesn’t just retrieve information—it understands what customers actually mean (intent) and delivers answers that are relevant, clear, and correct.

Vector search, not keyword search. Fin interprets the intent behind a question—even if it's phrased differently than your help content—and finds the most relevant knowledge.

Smarter chunking. A specialized chunking model breaks your help center into semantically meaningful pieces, improving both retrieval and response quality.

Context-aware reranking. Fin reorders search results based on accuracy and context, so it always prioritizes what will resolve the issue, not just what matches.

The result: More accurate answers, fewer escalations, and a better customer experience


### Built-In Validation


Fin’s responses don’t just sound smart—they are smart. Every reply goes through a multi-stage LLM validation flow: Refine → Generate → Validate. This ensures that what your customers see is always aligned with your business logic, brand voice, and the most up-to-date knowledge.

Refine: Iterative reasoning clarifies and improves intent alignment.

Generate: Answers are crafted with context, tone, and supporting data.

Validate: A hallucination critic and verifier confirm factual accuracy and adherence to policies.

Fin even runs parallel validation paths to deliver fast answers without compromising quality—something few others can match.


### Why It Matters


Fin isn’t just accurate—it’s consistently accurate, even under pressure. That’s because we’ve built and battle-tested this architecture across millions of real conversations, learning what works and improving every step.

Where others rely on a single model or a fragile chain of prompts, Fin combines deep AI infrastructure with real-world tuning. And that gives you answers you can trust—every time.


### Control & Complexity



### No-Code Power Control


With Fin, you’re in control. Business users can customize tone, logic, and workflows without code. Developers get powerful APIs for full extensibility. You get both flexibility and transparency.

Change fast. No waiting on engineering—your team can adapt behavior instantly.

Stay in control. From workflows to fallback paths, everything Fin does is visible and adjustable.

Move faster. Iterate without blockers and ship improvements as fast as your team can test them.


### Handles Real-World Complexity


Fin combines the power of generative AI with the precision of deterministic logic. That means it doesn’t just answer—it acts.

Process refunds. Cancel orders. Update accounts. With built-in guardrails and verifications, Fin completes real workflows securely and accurately.

Choose your level of control. Use structured flows when predictability matters, and natural language when flexibility counts—or blend both in one conversation.

Works across systems. Whether it's Shopify or Salesforce, Fin handles complex tasks across tools without losing context.

The bottom line? Fin resolves more requests, without requiring customers to bounce between chatbots, agents, or rigid flows.


### Unified with Human Support (Suite Only)


Fin is part of the Intercom Customer Service Suite—not a disconnected AI layer. That means:

Seamless handoffs. If a conversation moves to a human, no context is lost.

Smart routing. Fin escalates only when needed—and can even power hybrid workflows.

Controlled learning. You decide how Fin learns from your team to improve.

Unified analytics. Measure every interaction—AI and human—in one view.

No silos. No lost data. Just one consistent, intelligent support system.


### Execution & Scale



### Enterprise Scale


Fin doesn’t just perform in theory—it delivers in practice. With over 5,000 customers and millions of conversations analyzed, Fin’s architecture is tuned by real-world scale.


### 56% average resolution rate—and growing.



### Hundreds of live A/B tests power continuous improvement.



### Enterprise KPIs drive every product decision.



### Other vendors demo well. Fin delivers where it counts.



### Built to Perform, Built to Last


Fin runs on a globally distributed infrastructure designed for 24/7 mission-critical performance:


### 99.97% uptime over the past 12 months


Auto-scaling to handle surges—from Black Friday to product recalls

Global data residency, encryption, SOC 2 compliance, and more


### You can trust Fin to show up when it matters most.
