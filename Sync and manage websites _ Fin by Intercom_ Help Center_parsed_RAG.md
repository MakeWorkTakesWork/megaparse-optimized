# Now enter the URL of your external support content (top-level domain).

Make sure to use a public URL. We will search for all pages
nested under that URL and add them into Knowledge Hub.

Top-level domains like ntps/myhepcentercom will give
better results than nttps/mynelpcenter.com/nome.

This will fetch all of the pages from the website URL you provide and will read from all the
sub domain pages.

URLS globs to exclude a
+ Add

Add a list of URL globs to exclude certain pages you don't want to sync content from.


### # What is a url glob?


A glob is a string of literal and/or wildcard characters used to match file paths or URLS.
Globbing is the act of locating files on a filesystem using one or more globs. Using URL
globs also helps to get a range of URLS that are mostly the same, with only a small portion
of it changing between the requests.

For example, this URL glob tipsillstore,docs).example.com," lets the crawler access all
URLS starting with nttps:Istore.example.com. or ntps:/docs.example.com, and
https:lexample.com/"17-f00:"


### # CSS selectors to exclude


To exclude CSS selectors or avoid scraping content from specific sections, you can add a
list of the selectors you want to ignore.


### 09



### 00



### CSS selectors to exclude 9


Add a list of the CSS selectors you want to ignore to avoid scraping content from specific sections.


### header, footer, navbar


This is useful to skip irrelevant page content. The value must be a valid CSS selector as
accepted by the document.querySelectorAllg function. By default, we already remove
common navigation elements, headers, footers, modals, scripts, and inline images.


### # Clickable CSS selector


This allows for DOM elements identified by the CSS selector, to be clicked during the web
sync process.

### Clickable CSS selector


Add a CSS selector for expandable or clickable elements (e.g., tabs, dropdowns). These will be automatically
opened during the sync to capture more content.


### expandable.section.e. .tab


This is useful for expanding collapsed sections, in order to capture their text content. The
value must be a valid CSS selector as accepted by the document.querySelectorAllç
function.


### [Image: unknown]



### Examples are laria-expanded-l'falsel7, #expand_section


Complex conditions can be also described with a CSS selector. In CSS, chaining the
selectors without spaces creates an AND-like conaition, for example Dutton.Dlue.smal will
match only elements with all three classes.

Using comma G) as a separator works like OR, for example button, .blue, h1 targets all
elements with class button, or class blue, or first-level headings.

### # Wait to load CSS selector


To target content that may have a delay in appearing on the page, you can add a CSS
selector that will make the web scraper wait before scraping content.


### Wait to load CSS selector 0


Add a CSS selector that will make the web scraper wait betore scraping, targeting content that may have a delay
in appearing on the page.


### 0ded.contente, article.paragrapn


This is useful for pages for which the default content load recognition by idle network fails.
Setting this option completely disables the default behavior, and the page will be
processed only if the element specified by this selector appears.

The value must be a valid CSS selector as accepted by the
document.querySelectorAllg function.

One tool we and the developers over on our community/forum found really useful
when developing! Messenger. Apps was ngrok. This simple tool allows you to create
public URLS, which expose a web server on your development machine. You can use
these to set the webhook URLS while developing your app. This makes the
development process really lightweight, since you can play around by building an
app without any additional infrastructure, such as ac to an external serv This
can dramatically speed up the pro ocess of starting to build Messenger Apps.

# Learn how to set up Fin Al Agent for your customers or enable your team on using Fin
Al Copilot in the inbox.

Teammates require access to Fin Al Copilot to use it in the inbox. This can be
managed for each teammate from Settings > Teammates.


### # Make it available to a specific audience


If this website source is only relevant for a specific subset of customers, you can use
audience filters to make it visible to certain people.

First, you'll need to create and define the audience you want to target.

### # Troubleshooting website sync


When importing website content to enable Fin, you need to enter the public URL. This will
search for all pages nested under that URL and import them into your Knowledge Hub for
Fin Al Agent to use.

If the importer didn't return the number of pages you expected, there are a few reasons...


### The URL provided isn't the top level domain


The website sync works by going to the URL you provide and then searching for all pages
nested under that URL. These pages must have the same URL pattern as the URL you
provide.

### Sync and manage websites Fin by Intercom: Help Center


For example, if the top level domain is nttps/myne/pcenter.com/nome then all pages you
want to import must include /home prefix in the URL e.g.
https:!/myhelpcenter.com/nome/article, If they do not, remove the prefix and use the most
basic URL stem e.g. nttps:!/mynelpenter.com, then try the import again.


### # The URL is private


If the content you want to use is behind a login, Fin won't be able to access or import it.


### # Page limits


You can sync up to 10 different public URLS and Fin will sync a maximum of 3000 pages
from each source. Syncing can sometimes fail if there is a very large amount of content on
a single page (you'll be notified if a sync fails).
