A well-structured knowleage management system is the power source of any Al agent.
Whether using Fin Al Agent for customer interactions or Copilot as a personal assistant for
your support team, these tools need an organized and up-to-date knowledge base to
provide accurate responses. The good news is that your investment in knowledge content
adds value over time = a 30-minute effort to create a help document can save hundreds of
support hours by allowing Al to handle repetitive questions, resulting in satisfied customers
and valuable insights.

Here are our recommended steps to maximize your content readiness for Fin and make
sure your transition to Al-first customer service is smooth and successful.


### # Initial Setup



### # Step 1. Audit Your Existing Knowledge Base



### Knowledge Management Configuration


The first step is to ensure that Fin has as much knowleage about your business as possible.
Begin by ensuring that all relevant content has been added to the Knowleage Hub and IS
enabled for Fin, including any relevant external content from public webpages. Additionally,
you can further expand Fin's knowledge by adding team macros, snippets, PDFS, and
conversation content.


### Find and address content gaps


Review the content you currently have to ensure that Fin isn't learning from out-of-date
information. To make this task more manageable consider starting with a specific subset of
content and customers or addressing any recent functional or usability changes to your
product or service. Additionally analyzing your Support team's saved replies or frequently
used macros will help you to find content that can be turned into public-facing articles or
snippets.

Top Tip: Intercom had over 700 live articles to audit before using them to train Fin. We divided the articles into
product areas and gave relevant teams a week to check, update, or retire each article. Sharing the ownership broke
a mammoth job into achievable tasks.


### 1. Prioritize the most important updates first


Here are some tips to help you decide what to address first:

Use the Articles report to filter by articles which received the most negative
reactions, or started the most conversations over a selected time period, and
preview these conversations to see why customers still required human support
after viewing them.

Sort your content by 'Last updated' to find the content most likely to contain
outdated information.

Identify the high-traffic articles in your Help Center (based on metrics like views and
conversations started from articles), and make them as straightforward and
informative as you can.

informative as you can.


### 2. Involve key teams


Take an all-hands-on-deck approach to auditing and identifying gaps in your content.
Include your product, engineering, marketing, and customer success teams in this process
to get expert advice. Each team brings unique expertise and can help ensure content
accuracy and relevance.

Top Tip: We recommend having a dedicated Knowledge Management team that will drive this, whose responsibilities
would be to work with all the other teams and ensure that the right content is created and updated. This team can be
Support reps and doesn't have to be a knowledge manager as such but they should be accountable for setting up
and optimizing content.


### 3. Review Content for Al Readiness


Al and humans both benefit from clear, straightforward, and comprehensive articles. If a
human finds an article contusing, chances are an Al agent will too. Analyze reports on your
current support content to pinpoint articles that need optimization. Al can be particularly
helpful in this process, reformatting existing content and incorporating best practices.

Prompt 1: Refine Help Center Content:

Ihave some help center content that I'd like to refine. Please ensure the content follows these best practices:


### 1. Avoid Ambiguity


Ensure the language is clear and detailed enough for both humans and AI to understand without
confusion.

Replace vague statements with specific examples or explanations.


### 2. Restate Questions Clearly


Write content with full context, as if answering in a formal setting. Avoid leaving questions
unanswered or ambiguous.


### 3. Use Headers for Organization


Add appropriate headers (H1, H2, H3) to organize sections clearly.

o Repeat essential header information in the body of the paragraph for clarity.


### 4. Use Bulleted Lists


Break down long or complex paragraphs into concise, scannable bulleted lists where possible.


### 5. Avoid Asking Al to Perform Math


For processes involving calculations, explain them step-Dy-step with examples where necessary.


### 6. Include Contact Details


Provide specific contact details and organize them clearly for ease of use.

Please apply these principles to the following content. Organize, rephrase, and format it as needed to make it clear,
scannable, and user-friendly for both customers and Al agents.

### [Copy and Paste Content]



### # Step 2. Address your content backlog



### Step 2. Creating new content



### Prioritize content updates


The first step is to identify the content that will have the highest impact on reducing support
volume

1. Start with data: Look at data and metrics from your conversations to find FAQs,
queries that have the longest handle time, and conversation topics that have lower
CSAT scores.

1. Prioritize topics: Start with high-impact features (e.g., premium features) before
focusing on less critical content.

1. Sort by last updated: Filter by 'Last updated' to find help articles that haven't been
updated in a while and may need a refresh.


### Decide what information you'll feed the Al


When sourcing content be sure to cast a wide net as all information is useful once it's
framed the right way. Draw from all available sources (e.g., help centers, macros, blog
posts) and for Copilot draw from internal documents, as well as past cases and
conversations. All of these content sources can be managed directly in knowileage Hub SO
you can decide which is used and with which user segments.


### Develop a template for content updates


You can streamline content proauction with a simple template for your knowledge base. A
clear, comprenensive article, FAQ, or blog post helps both Al agents like Fin and your
customers consume content more easily.

o Focus on high-volume, repetitive queries or topics that customers frequently ask about.


### 2. Write Clear Answers


Provide direct, easy-to-understond answers to each question.

Avoid ambiguity and include any relevant details for full clarity.


### 3. Format for Accessibility

### Develop a template for content updates


You can streamline content proauction with a simple template for your knowledge base. A
clear, comprenensive article, FAQ, or blog post helps both Al agents like Fin and your
customers consume content more easily.

Some best practices to follow:

Avoid simple "yes" or "no" answers, use tables, lists, and bullet points to organize
information for quicker access.

Tailor articles for different user types by clearly specifying the intended audience.


### Add explanatory text to images or videos for context.


Define special terms and spell out acronyms the first time they appear.


### # Allocate resources strategically


Be intentional about carving out time to work on knowledge management. Dedicate time
and a team to working on support content regularly. This can be a mix of support reps and
engineers collaborating with a knowledge manager.


### # Step 3: Internal Testing



### Test Fin's Responses Before Launch


Before setting Fin live, you can review and improve Fin's responses to real-world customer
questions. This is a great way of seeing exactly how Fin will look and behave, without any
customers seeing it. It also helps identify any obvious gaps in content or improvements
needed in their set up.

Fin Preview: Fin provides previews in the Train section, which are for manual,
one-off, in-context testing. When you're tweaking guidance or deployment settings
like intro messages, you can quickly preview how this feels from the end user's
standpoint.

Fin Testing: Test your content readiness by seeing how Fin would respond to actual
customer queries. Review the sources and settings that shape Fin's answers, and
receive tailored recommendations to improve answers to deliver the highest quality
support for your customers.

Fin Deployment: You can launch Fin to a small test or internal audience (e.g.
yourself and teammates) on your website and monitor Fin's replies for quality and
accuracy.

Top Tip: Create a set of control questions to assess, checking whether Fin provided the best response. These can
also be used to compare Fin's answers to a human agent.


### Refine Fins Answers


Make adjustments to improve the quality and accuracy of Fin's answer based on testing
results. If Fin's answer has missed the mark, it's typically due to one of these reasons:

Gaps in content: Update or add content SO Fin can provide a better answer next

Some best practices to follow:

Avoid simple "yes" or "no" answers, use tables, lists, and bullet points to organize
information for quicker access.

Tailor articles for different user types by clearly specifying the intended audience.

### Refine Fins Answers


Make adjustments to improve the quality and accuracy of Fin's answer based on testing
results. If Fin's answer has missed the mark, it's typically due to one of these reasons:

Gaps in content: Update or add content SO Fin can provide a better answer next

time this can include syncing new content sources, updating an existing article or
creating a snippet

Poor phrasing: This is a common problem, check whether your content reflects
customer terminology and phrasing.

Lack of guidance: Add or review the guidance that has been set, ensuring it follows
best practice

Missing data: Ensure Fin has access to the right data to carry out the specific task


### Put yourself in your customers' shoes


Put yourself through the same steps that your customer will take when they look for help.
As part of deployment, test it yourself. Test the quality of answers and collate a list of
missing topics or keywords


### # Ongoing Optimization



### Step 4. Monitor KPIs to measure success



### Review key performance indicators


Once you've started using Fin, it's critical to keep a close eye and monitor KPIs such as
customer satisfaction (CSAT), resolution rates, and more. Some relevant KPIs to watch out
for include:


### 1. CSAT (for both Al agents and humans)



### 2. Fin resolution rate



### 3. Fin involvement rate



### 4. First response time



### 5. Average handling time



### 6. Number of handovers to human support reps


Top Tip: Start with the Holistic Overview Report which gives visibility into the overall health of your entire support
operation with a unified view of human and automated support.


### Identify key areas for improvement


Through reporting you will have ample data on where Fin excels and where it struggles.
This can be used to identify content gaps or areas for improvement, especially in topics
with low resolution rates or satisfaction scores. There are multiple resources at your
disposal to identify and improve Fin's resolution rate and performance.

1. Analyze Content Gaps: Check unresolved questions to identify customer pain
points not being currently served by Fin.

1. Review Content performance: Check the performance of individual content
sources to see their involvement and resolutions rates

1. Enable Fin AI CSAT: Reviewing where things went wrong, either due to workflow
setup or the answer Fin provided based on your available content


### # Put your learnings into action


It's unlikely that you'll get everything right immediately and there will be some problems Al
can't solve yet. This gives you real data about what your customers need and value to
achieve "true" resolutions. Iterate based on what the data is telling you. This continuous
improvement will drive better customer outcomes.


### # Step 5. Consistently audit and update your content



### Maintain ongoing content audits


Set up a schedule for content review. As your product, customers, and business goals
evolve, SO too should your support content. This means you need to build, maintain,
update, and create new content on an ongoing basis.


### # Weekly QA of unresolved conversations


Look at reports on your content performance and review individual unresolved
conversations to build context as to what went wrong. Take action based on why Fin
couldn't answer these questions to refine pertormance and answer quality.

Top tip: We have created a custom report under Fin Al Agent in reports which is available to customers to spot check
individual conversations.


### # Weekly analysis of low CSAT conversations


Look at your CSAT performance reports and pull the list of conversations with a CSAT of 1,
2, and 3 and revlew/categorise them (choose multiple): missing content, missing guidance,
poor Al answer quality, required action, good Al answer, mistrust of Al answer. Take action
based on why Fin couldn't resolve these questions to refine performance and answer
quality

Top Tip: Map out a plan for updating your content that outlines:

1. Who is responsible for refreshing or creating new content.

1. How often existing content should be reviewed SO it doesn't become stale.

1. When they should do this (.e. for one hour per day, every Friday, monthly, or whatever cadence makes
sense for your team).


### Develop a system to log requests for new content


1. Analyze Content Gaps: Check unresolved questions to identify customer pain
points not being currently served by Fin.

1. Review Content performance: Check the performance of individual content
sources to see their involvement and resolutions rates

1. Enable Fin AI CSAT: Reviewing where things went wrong, either due to workflow

sense for your team).


### Develop a system to log requests for new content


Create a simple system for teammates from across the company to flag outdated content or
suggest new additions. That way you can capture insights from all customer-facing and
product teams = and address customer needs from every angle.

# Step 6. Integrate knowledge management into
launches


### Make content part of the product development process


It's crucial that knowledge management is included in product development and
go-to-market plans. Work with your product team, product managers, and product
marketing managers to build out your launch content, then review customer conversations
after going live to spot opportunities for additional resources.

Top Tip: Updating or creating new conter nt should be a critical part of the product release process as this ensures
that the content is always accurate and Fin has the relevant knowledge at the same time that the new product or
changes are made.


### Knowledge Feedback Loop


Create a simple system for teammates from across the company to flag outdated content or
suggest new additions. That way you can capture insights from all customer-facing and
product teams = and address customer needs from every angle.

### # Initial Setup



### # Step 1. Audit Your Existing Knowledge Base



### # Ensure Fin Has Access to Your Content


The first step is to ensure that Fin has as much knowleage about your business as possible.
Begin by ensuring that all relevant content has been added to the Knowleage Hub and is
enabled for Fin, including any relevant external content from public webpages. Additionally,
you can further expand Fin's knowledge by adding team macros, snippets, PDFS, and
conversation content.

Also, consider whether any content needs to be enabled specifically for Fin. When Fin has
more to learn from, it performs better.

Top Tip: We recommend having a dedicated Knowledge Management team that will drive this, whose responsibilities
would be to work with all the other teams and ensure that the right content is created and updated. This team can be
Support reps and doesn't have to be a knowledge manager as such but they should be accountable for setting up
and optimizing content.


### Identify Gaps and Outdated Info


Review the content you currently have to ensure that Fin isn't learning from out-of-date
information. To make this task more manageable consider starting with a specific subset of
content and customers or addressing any recent functional or usability changes to your
product or service. Additionaly analyzing your Support team's saved replies or frequently
used macros will help you to find content that can be turned into puplic-Tacing articles or
snippets.


### Prioritize High-Impact Updates


Use data to identify what to update first. Here are some tips to help you decide what to
address first:

Use the Articles report to filter by articles which received the most negative
reactions, or started the most conversations over a selected time period, and
preview these conversations to see why customers still required human support
after viewing them.

information. To make this task more manageable consider starting with a specific subset of
content and customers or addressing any recent functional or usability changes to your
product or service. Additionaly analyzing your Support team's saved replies or frequently
used macros will help you to find content that can be turned into puplic-Tacing articles or
snippets.


### Prioritize High-Impact Updates


Use data to identify what to update first. Here are some tips to help you decide what to
address first:

Use the Articles report to filter by articles which received the most negative
reactions, or started the most conversations over a selected time period, and
preview these conversations to see why customers still required human support
after viewing them.

Sort your content by 'Last updated' to find the content most likely to contain
outdated information.

Identify the nigh-tratric articles in your Help Center (based on metrics like views and
conversations started from articles), and make them as straightforward and
informative as you can.


### Focus on high-impact or premium features first



### Involve Cross-Functional Teams


Take an all-hands-on-deck approach to auditing and identifying gaps in your content.
Include your product, engineering, marketing, and customer success teams in this process
to get expert advice. Each team brings unique expertise and can help ensure content
accuracy and relevance.

Top Tip: Intercom had over 700 live articles to audit before using them to train Fin. We divided the articles into
product areas and gave relevant teams a week to check, update, or retire each article. Sharing the ownership broke
a mammoth job into achievable tasks.


### # Step 2. New content Development


Feed the Right Information to Al Pull knowledge from a wide range of sources:


### Help centers



### Macros and saved replies



### Blog posts



### Internal tools (e.g., Notion, Guru)



### Historical support conversations and past cases


Use Knowledge Hub to manage visibility and control which sources Fin and Copilot use by user
segment.

Develop a Content Template Standardize how you write:


### Avoid simple yes"'no" answers- explain with context



### Use bullet points, tables, and steps for clarity



### Specify intended audience



### Include explanatory text for images and videos

Top Tip: Updating knowledge content should be part of the product release checklist to
ensure Fin is never caught off guard.


### Prioritize content updates


The first step is to identify the content that will have the highest impact on reducing support
volume

1. Start with data: Look at data and metrics from your conversations to find FAQs,
queries that have the longest handle time, and conversation topics that have lower
CSAT scores.

a. Analyze Content Gaps: Check unresolved questions to identify customer
pain points not being currently served by Fin.

b. Review Content performance: Check the pertormance of individual content
sources to see their involvement and resolutions rates

C. Enable Fin Al CSAT: Reviewing where things went wrong, either due to
workflow setup or the answer Fin provided based on your available content


### d.


1. Prioritize topics: Start with high-impact features (e.g., premium features) before
focusing on less critical content.

1. Sort by last updated: Filter by 'Last updated to find help articles that haven't been
updated in a while and may need a refresh.


### Decide what information you'll feed the Al


When sourcing content be sure to cast a wide net as all information is useful once it's
framed the right way. Draw from all available sources (e.g., help centers, macros, blog
posts) and for Copilot draw from internal documents, as well as past cases and
conversations. All of these content sources can be managed directly in knowileage Hub SO
you can decide which is used and with which user segments.


### # Develop a template for content updates


You can streamline content production with a simple template for your knowledge base. A
clear, comprehensive article, FAQ, or blog post helps both Al agents like Fin and your
customers consume content more easily.

Some best practices to follow:

Avoid simple "yes" or "no" answers, use tables, lists, and bullet points to organize
information for quicker access.

Tailor articles for different user types by clearly specifying the intended audience.


### Add explanatory text to images or videos for context.


Define special terms and spell out acronyms the first time they appear.


### 4. Review Content for Al Readiness


Al and humans both benefit from clear, straightforward, and comprehensive articles. If a
human finds an article confusing, chances are an Al agent will too. Analyze reports on your
current support content to pinpoint articles that need optimization. Al can be particularly
helpful in this process, reformatting existing content and incorporating best practices.

### Develop a system to log requests for new content


Create a simple system for teammates from across the company to flag outdated content or
suggest new additions. That way you can capture insights from all customer-racing and
product teams - and address customer needs from every angle.


### Make content part of the product development process


It's crucial that knowledge management is included in product development and
go-to-market plans. Work with your product team, product managers, and product
marketing managers to build out your launch content, then review customer conversations
after going live to spot opportunities for additional resources.

Top Tip: Updating or creating new content should be a critical part of the product release process as this ensures
that the content is always accurate and Fin has the relevant knowledge at the same time that the new product or
changes are made.


### # Step 3: Internal Testing



### # Test Fin's Responses Before Launch


Before setting Fin live, you can review and improve Fin's responses to real-world customer
questions. This is a great way of seeing exactly how Fin will look and behave, without any
customers seeing it. It also helps identify any obvious gaps in content or improvements
needed in their set up.

Fin Preview: Fin provides previews in the Train section, which are for manual,
one-off, in-context testing. When you're tweaking guidance or deployment settings
like intro messages, you can quickly preview how this feels from the end user's
standpoint.

Fin Testing: Test your content readiness by seeing how Fin would respond to actual
customer queries. Review the sources and settings that shape Fin's answers, and
receive tailored recommendations to improve answers to deliver the highest quality
support for your customers.

Fin Deployment: You can launch Fin to a small test or internal audience (e.g.
yourself and teammates) on your website and monitor Fin's replies for quality and
accuracy.

Top Tip: Create a set of control questions to assess, checking whether Fin provided the best response. These can
also be used to compare Fin's answers to a human agent.


### # Refine Fins Answers


Make adjustments to improve the quality and accuracy of Fin's answer based on testing
results. If Fin's answer has missed the mark, it's typically due to one of these reasons:

Gaps in content: Update or add content SO Fin can provide a better answer next
time-this can include syncing new content sources, updating an existing article or
creating a snippet

Poor phrasing: This is a common problem, check whether your content reflects
customer terminology and phrasing.

Lack of guidance: Add or review the guidance that has been set, ensuring it follows
best practice

Missing data: Ensure Fin has access to the right data to carry out the specific task


### # Put yourself in your customers' shoes


Put yourself through the same steps that your customer will take when they look for help.
As part of deployment, test it yourself. Test the quality of answers and collate a list of
missing topics or keywords


### # Step 4. Monitor KPIs to measure success



### Review key performance indicators


Once you've started using Fin, it's critical to keep a close eye and monitor KPIs such as
customer satisfaction (CSAT), resolution rates, and more. Some relevant KPIs to watch out
for include:


### 7. CSAT (for both Al agents and humans)



### 8. Fin resolution rate



### 9. Fin involvement rate



### 10. First response time



### 11. Average handling time

### Identify key areas for improvement


Through reporting you will have ample data on where Fin excels and where it struggles.
This can be used to identify content gaps or areas for improvement, especially in topics
with low resolution rates or satisfaction scores. There are multiple resources at your
disposal to identify and improve Fin's resolution rate and performance.

1. Analyze Content Gaps: Check unresolved questions to identify customer pain
points not being currently served by Fin.

1. Review Content performance: Check the performance of individual content
sources to see their involvement and resolutions rates

1. Enable Fin AI CSAT: Reviewing where things went wrong, either due to workflow
setup or the answer Fin provided based on your available content


### # Put your learnings into action


It's unlikely that you'll get everything right immediately and there will be some problems Al
can't solve yet. This gives you real data about what your customers need and value to
achieve "true" resolutions. Iterate based on what the data is telling you. This continuous
improvement will drive better customer outcomes.


### Maintain ongoing content audits


Set up a schedule for content review. As your product, customers, and business goals
evolve, SO too should your support content. This means you need to build, maintain,
update, and create new content on an ongoing basis.


### # Weekly QA of unresolved conversations


Look at reports on your content performance and review individual unresolved
conversations to build context as to what went wrong. Take action based on why Fin
couldn't answer these questions to refine performance and answer quality.

Top tip: We have created a custom report under Fin Al Agent in reports which is available to cus stc on mers to spot check
individual conversations.


### # Weekly analysis of low CSAT conversations


Look at your CSAT performance reports and pull the list of conversations with a CSAT of 1,
2, and 3 and review/categorise them (choose multiple): missing content, missing guidance,
poor Al answer quality, required action, good Al answer, mistrust of Al answer. Take action

Top Tip: Map out a plan for updating your content that outlines:

1. Who is responsible for refreshing or creating new content.

1. How often existing content should be reviewed SO it doesn't become stale.

1. When they should do this (.e. for one hour per day, every Friday, monthly, or whatever cadence makes
sense for your team).


### Step 1: Audit and Organize Your Existing Knowledge



### Ensure Fin Has Access to Your Content


Add all relevant resources to the Knowledge Hub, including:


### Help center articles



### Team macros and snippets



### PDFS and internal documentation



### Public webpages

setup, maintenance, and cross-functional COllaboration.


### Carve Out Time and Resources


Schedule time for ongoing content work, involving both support reps and engineers. Make this a
consistent team effort.


### Identify Gaps and Outdated Info



### Review your knowledge base for outdated information


Start with a subset of content, such as based on product area or customer segment

Turn internal macros or saved replies into public-facing content (articles or snippets)

Top Tip: Intercom audited 700+ articles by dividing them among product teams and assigning a
one-week deadline to update, retire, or approve.

Prioritize High-Impact Updates Use data to identify what to update first:


### Filter articles by 'Last updated' to find stale content



### Review metrics for most-viewed or most-queried articles


Analyze articles that triggered negative feedback or started conversations

### Gaps in content: Add or update knowledge articles/snippets



### Poor phrasing: Align content to customer terminology


Lack of guidance: Improve instructions or parameters in Fin's configuration

Missing data: Ensure Fin has access to required systems or sources

outdated content or suggest additions. This helps incorporate input from across customer-facing
roles.

Integrate Content into Product Launches Work with product managers and marketing to
document and publish content alongside product changes. Post-launch, review conversations to
identify new content needs.

Top Tip: Updating knowledge content should be part of the product release checklist to ensure
Fin is never caught off guard.

### # Step 4: Monitor Performance and Iterate


Track KPIs That Matter Keep an eye on key metrics:


### CSAT (for Al and human support)



### Fin resolution rate



### Fin involvement rate



### First response time



### Average handle time



### Handover rate to human support


Top Tip: Use the Holistic Overview Report to track both Al and human support performance in
one place.


### Use Reports to Identify Improvements



### Review unresolved questions to uncov ver pain points



### Analyze performance of individual content sources



### Check low-CSAT conversations to see where Fin fell short


Enable Fin Al CSAT Use Fin's Al-specific CSAT tool to evaluate poor ratings and pinpoint
whether content, setup, or expectations need refining.

Iterate Based on Insights It's okay if Fin isn't perfect from the start. Use real data to identify
what your customers are asking and where content or Fin's responses need refinement.

Maintain a Regular Audit Cadence Your content should evolve as your business does. Set a
review schedule and stick to it.

# Weekly Tasks:

QA unresolved conversations: Diagnose why Fin couldn't respond and fix the root
issue

Review low-CSAT conversations: Categorize reasons (missing content, poor Al
response, mistrust of AI) and take action

Top Tip: Build a content update plan that outlines:


### Who owns which parts of the knowledge base



### How often updates are required


When reviews should happen (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly)
