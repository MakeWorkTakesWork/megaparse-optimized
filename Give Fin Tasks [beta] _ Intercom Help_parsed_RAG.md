Fin Tasks allow you to automate more complex processes with Fin. Often times, these
processes may involve connections to your external systems that need to reliably follow your
specific business rules (e.g. cancel an order, refund a subscription). Fin will trigger the task and
be actively involved each step to resolve customer queries.

Fin Tasks is currently in a closed beta. If you're interested in getting access, please speak
to your Intercom Relationship or Customer Success Manager.

Why are Fin Tasks smarter and more powerful than traditional workflows?
Easier setup with natural language

Rather than using conventional workflows built by adding multiple steps-r messages, branches,
actions- you can set up Fin Tasks using natural language.

You also no longer have to build complex decision trees to guide the user down the correct
path based on their query; all of this can be handled by a simple description of a single Fin
Task.

# Automate more processes with Al that typically required a human

Using Fin Tasks, Fin can handle interactions that would otherwise require human action. For
example, Fin can take a customer through extensive troubleshooting steps or analyze images
of damaged orders from customers. These Al-driven enhancements reduce manual workload
while ensuring customers receive fast, accurate, and intelligent responses without needing
human intervention


### # Create a more conversational customer experience


Fin Tasks eliminate the need for customers to click through multiple buttons to reach the right
solution. The entire experience feels much more natural and conversational, making it easier
and more intuitive for customers to get the help they need.


### [Image: unknown]


For instance, you can instruct Fin to collect data as part of a task and instead of providing an Z

input box for the user to type into, Fin will conversationaly say something like "Can you please
specify the subscription you are referring to?"

# What's the difference between Fin Tasks and Data connectors?

You may have heard about our Data connectors feature. Both Data connectors and Tasks can
be triggered by Fin, and they share a key similarity: You define a natural language description
of when they should trigger, and Fin automatically activates them when a customer's question
matches. So, what sets them apart?

Data connectors: Simple, Single-Step API Calls
A Data connector is a single API call, best suited for straighttorward, single-turn customer
questions.

For example:


### "What's the status of my order?"


This requires a simple response either the order is fulfilled or it isn't. Fin can handle this by
making a single API request to retrieve the order status.

A Fin Task (the focus of this article) is more powerful. It combines multiple Data connectors
(API calls) with your business logic, making it ideal for multi-turn customer questions.

For example:
"l'd like a refund for my order."

This is more complex:

Fin may need to first check if the customer is eligible for a refund.


### It might also verify if they've previously requested one.


The process could involve multiple API calls-one to fetch order details and another to
issue the refund if eligibility criteria are met.

We recommend to use Data connectors for the simple use cases and Fin Tasks for the more
complex ones.

# What to consider when setting up Fin Tasks and Data connectors

Setting up Fin Tasks and Data connectors takes a blend of technical awareness, process
thinking, and collaboration. While the experience is becoming easier over time, here are the
key areas to focus on:

Choose high-impact processes to automate: Start by identifying 1-2 workflows where
automation could meaningfully reduce support volume. Look for repeatable processes that
currently rely on human intervention. Your Intercom Overview report is a great place to
spot trends and uncover cor mmon issues being routed to your team.

Understand your API requirements: Many Tasks depend on connecting to APIs to fetch or
update data (i.e Data connectors). Make sure you know which APIs are needed, what they
return, and how they'lI be used within the Task.

Work cross-functionaly: Setting up Tasks often requires input from product, engineering,
or operations teams especially when APIs need to be built or updated. Clear
communication around the desired workflow ensures the right systems are in place.

Test and iterate: Building great Tasks is rarely a one-shot effort. Expect to test different
approaches with Task instructions, debug edge cases, and refine as you go to improve
reliability and end-user experience.

Getting these fundamentals right will help you launch faster and build more effective Fin-
powered Tasks.

# How does Fin decide whether to trigger a Task, Data Connector, or
content-based answer?

Fin evaluates all three-Tasks, Data Connectors, and content based answers at the same
priority level. It selects the best match based on user intent. If the query leads down the
content-based answer path, Fin prioritizes Custom Answers over general knowledge content
or snippets.

### 1. Give your task trigger a title and description


Every Fin task should be given a title telling Fin when to trigger the task. This is very important,
SO that Fin triggers it at the right time.

Similarly to the title, the description also tells Fin when it should trigger the task, in greater
detail. This describes the situation Fin should use the task, provide example customer queries,
and could also call out situations where Fin should not use this task.

Use Wait for webhook to pause the task until it receives a webhook request. This is ideal for
processes that require external input before moving forward.

Imagine your task needs to integrate with an external system = such as a third-party application
for identity verification. With Wait for webhook, the task stops at this step until the external
system sends a webhook response. Once received, the task resumes and takes action based
on the provided data.


### # Examples


Identity Verification: Pause the task until a third-party service contirms a user's identity.

Payment Confirmation: Wait for a webhook from your payment provider to confirm a
transaction before proceeding.

Order Fulfillment: Pause until your inventory system sends an update about stock
availability.

Approval Processes: Hold the task until a third-party tool sends an approval or rejection
status.

This feature ensure: S your tasks are seamless and synchronized with external systems, reducing
manual intervention and keeping things efficient! To add Wait for webhook to your task, simply
click Add step and search for "Wait for webhook".

### # Best practices when using "Wait for webhook"



## Z


Add a clear name to the step to make it easy to identify temporary variables created
for the step

Configure the example request properly by including all the fields you expect to
receive in the webhook callback within the data object.

Ensure the webhook returns a JSON body that matches the structure in the step. If
the JSON structure is updated, no data will be received. Missing fields in the
configuration will also make those fields inaccessible in the task.

Click the "Copy" button to copy the webhook URL to your clipboard. On the third-
party site where the webhook is triggered, ensure the conversationld is passed as
expected.

Note: The webhook endpoint supports idempotency to safely retry requests and prevent
the same operation from being performed more than once. When sending a request,
include an dempotency-Key header with a unique value. We recommend using UUIDs.
Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours.
