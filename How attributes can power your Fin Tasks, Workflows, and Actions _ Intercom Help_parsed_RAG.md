How attributes can power your Fin Tasks, Workflows, and Actions IIntercom Help

These used to store data about users and leads in Intercom. By default, Intercom comes with
some basic attributes such as name, phone number, email, etc. You can also add your own
custom data attributes depending on the needs of your business. Examples include:


### Tier or plan that the user is on



### Last invoice amount



### Last item purchased



### # Company data attributes


Similar to people data attributes, company attributes are used to provide more data about the
companies your business deals with via Intercom. Some default attributes include company
name, industry, company website and ID. You can always create more custom attributes, for
example:


### Company tax/VAT ID



### Number of employees



### Whether a company is a subsidiary or not



### =



## N



### =



### # Conversation/ticket attributes


These are great for storing data about the ticket or conversation that your support team is
working on, whether that is to give more context on a customer's issue or for categorization
and reporting purposes. Examples of conversation/ticket data attributes include:


### Category or reason for customer query



## Product customer is contacting about



### Follow up needed (true / false)



### Temporary attributes [NEW]


Workflows and Fin Tasks can use a new type of attribute called a "temporary attribute". This
feature is currently in beta.

Temporary attributes are useful when you need data only for the current workflow and don't
want to save it permanently in Intercom for reporting or other purposes. You can create these
attributes to hold information that's relevant to the specific workflow being executed.

For example you can create a temporary attribute to:

Here, you can also set up temporary attributes via the "Results" tab when configuring a Fin
Task. These are used to tell Fin what data to output from the task.

For example, you might instruct Fin to classify a user's query and save this as a temporary data
attribute:

"If the user is contacting requesting a refund, set the value of the attribute "contact reason" to


### "refund".


If they're asking about exchanges, set the value to "exchange"*

If they are reporting a fault item, set the value to "faulty item".

### # Collecting data in a Workflow or Fin Task


If you wish to collect data and store it for the user, company, conversation or just temporarily in
your Workflow or Fin Task, you can do SO by using the "Collect data" step. This is useful if you
want to later use the collected data to create conditional logic in the Workflow / Fin Task using
branching.
