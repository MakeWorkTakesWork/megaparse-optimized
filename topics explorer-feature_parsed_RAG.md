title: TOPICS EXPLORER SUMMARY AND TRANSCRIPT CONVERSATION: SUMMARY: This is a really beautiful product so I'm excited to have us spread the word. We're going to try one new thing this time to see if these posts perform better than others: I'm going to give you the bullets so that you need to write the post in your own words. This is a little more work, and fewer people might do it, but we will learn how much your own voice and message matters. Topics Explorer Businesses have hundreds of thousands of customer conversations a year, but no good way to understand all of them. Topics Explorer fixes that. It is a new type of product that uses AI to organize every single customer conversation into topics and sub-topics. This gives you an unprecedented view of what’s driving support volume and impacting quality. You can easily spot patterns, track trends, and catch emerging issues before they impact your customer experience. Topics Explorer exposes emergent patterns useful to teams across the entire company. You can drill right down from a topic, into sub topics, into groups of conversations in that sub topic, into individual conversations. Also, feel free to pull more content from the videos - there is plenty more there.

TRANSCRIPT:

0:03: Your customer conversations have all this insight into this question, but you can't access it. 0:08: There are thousands of customer conversations a year. 0:11: Some businesses have hundreds of thousands of customer conversations a year, all buried in a database, inaccessible. 0:18: You could argue it's the most valuable source of customer insight in an entire company. 0:22: In an entire company, product team, the marketing team, the leadership team, if only they could access summaries, insights into these hundreds of thousands of conversations, what would you learn, what would you change? 0:34: How could I help you grow your business? 0:36: So, There's two problems here. 0:38: One is that the work has been too manual historically, manually tagging things, slow analysis. 0:44: And the second problem is that you're working with a limited view. 0:47: This manual tagging that people do today trying to understand what people are saying about their business, it's a taxonomy you create. 0:53: You decide what the tags should be, and then you get the team or use automation to filter things into those tags. 0:59: But the problem with that approach is taxonomies that you create can show you the areas that you set yourself, but it also shows you what the areas that you didn't create, the tags you didn't know about, and a lot of these insights, these hundreds of thousands of conversations, they've emerged into patterns in them. 1:15: There are things happening in there that you can see and could never foresee. 1:18: So you'd never be able to like put a taxonomy against it or create tags for it when you actually don't even know it's there. 1:24: AI can fix this. 1:26: So what we've done is built a product with an insights called Topics Explorer. 1:30: This is a really, really powerful thing. 1:33: It uses AI to group all conversations into topics and into subtopics. 1:38: It does this automatically, it does it in real time. 1:42: You know, I wrote down it does it magically. 1:43: It feels like magic. 1:44: It just does this automatically in the background every single conversation. 1:48: So you get the full range of what your customers are saying and every single word that they say.

0:00: I think actually what really surprised us is how useful the topics explorer is. 0:05: With the topics explorer, , it feels like we can get qualitative level insights at quantitative scale, pretty much, and there's something that feels quite subtle and we didn't really realise it until we used it for a while where I think because you get this bird's eye view and it resolves to real conversations with real people, it actually completely deonomizes your view on your users and your customers. 0:25: And so even though we get similar signal from doing user research sessions, , product analytics, and so on and so forth, it just feels. 0:33: In some ways, extremely honest, , and it enables us to be way more user-centric. 0:37: And so it's one of our like major heartbeats I'd say in terms of how we keep in touch with our users and make sure that we're doing the right thing.

0:02: Hi, I'm Molly, and I'm principal AA designer at Intercom. 0:06: Measuring quality hasn't kept up with modern support, and the same goes for tracking what customers are talking about. 0:12: Most teams still tag data by hand or they pull insights from multiple dashboards, which is slow, and it never gives you the full picture. 0:19: But now we have Topics Explorer, which uses AI to automatically analyze and categorize every single customer conversation into broad topics and granular subtopics, which gives you an unprecedented view of what's driving support volume and impacting quality without any manual tagging or label data. 0:38: So it helps teens discover things they didn't already know. 0:41: Let's take a look. 0:43: I opened up Topics Explorer and I'm looking at the past 4 weeks. 0:48: The color represents the customer experience score, and the size of the boxes is the volume of the 15 biggest contact drivers. 0:57: So on the left, I have a high level view of what customers are asking about, and on the right I can see, week by week, what's changing over time. 1:06: Now, I work on Fin, and it is a large contact driver. 1:09: Fin features I see is the number 2 driver. 1:13: , so this is where I want to dig in today. 1:15: I can see that the CX score is 81.4%, which is pretty solid. 1:20: It's not the best, it's not the worst of these large volume topics. 1:24: Has anything weird happened over the last month with it? 1:26: I can look for that on the right. 1:28: So Fin features, the thing that stands out the most to me is that last week there was a lot more volume than the week before, but it looks like the CX score itself is, you know, , fluctuating within like a limited range, that's not too, too worrisome. 1:44: Let me dig into this and look at the subtopics and see if I can get more detail about what's going on. 1:51: So I can see that usage and capabilities like is big. 1:55: It also had a big peak last week, but what's a little more interesting to me is looking at this CX score fluctuation for Fin response customization and follow-ups. 2:05: So this is an area where I might want to dig in like what happened on May 9th. 2:11: I can click in and view the specific conversations and scores for that day, get an understanding of what's happening. 2:19: Because I work on Fin, I also, I want to look at other metrics, not just the CX score, but for instance, resolution rate, how well is Fin answering questions about Finn? 2:28: When I look at that, I see again some fluctuation in the response, customization and follow-ups, but some of these low scores are really low volume days, so maybe it's not actually that that worrisome. 2:41: What might stick out to me here is this other subtopic, fin tasks and actions. 2:46: There's a a big spike on May 14th, it's like double the day before and the resolution rate is less than 50%. 2:55: So that's an area I might dig into and try to understand like what's going on, right? 3:00: That resolution rate dipped the same time that the volume spiked. 3:03: So I've quickly been able to spot interesting areas that that might be outliers or places to Improve service or improve our health content. 3:11: And and that's why Topics Explore is such a powerful way to spot trends and uncover insights about your customer conversations. 3:18: It doesn't just show you what customers are are talking about, but let's you spot patterns and catch emerging issues before they impact your customer experience. 3:27: And we're really just getting started. 3:29: During the beta, we'll be working to allow you to guide how topics are shaped, and that'll give you even more control over what you track. 3:36: So watch this space. 3:38: Thanks.
