### ========================================


The 50M+ figure refers to conversations where Fin was involved aka involvement rate - as of April 23rd. Fin is just 2 years old, and we've already run 200+ A/B tests, which is more than one experiment every week. Most companies don’t have the scale, data volume, or operational discipline to optimize AI this rigorously. It shows how seriously we invest in making Fin better, faster, and more reliable over time.

Fin starts by scanning 120 articles and 4 workflows to understand the issue.

It pulls the right guidance from a workflow—then triggers a new workflow as the conversation evolves.

Fin follows the 'No' branch, accesses data from an integration, and updates the order status.

It then uses the ‘Cancel Order’ action to fully resolve the request.
