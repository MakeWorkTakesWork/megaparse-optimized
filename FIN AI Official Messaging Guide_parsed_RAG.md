Forethought These vendors claim to offer high performing, fast, and self-improving AI agents. These tools often require vendor support to maintain performance. (Link) They offer limited flexibility, struggle with real-world complexity, and their performance plateaus quickly. (Link, Link ) Customer Service Industry Experience: Fin: The team behind Fin have been in the CS industry for over a decade and have a deep understanding of customer service. We are one of the most trusted CS software providers in the space. Competitors: These competitors are new startups with less than 3 years experience in the space, and even less experience in CS. Buyers who choose these competitors are at risk of them going under or being acquired – their future is uncertain.

Self-Serve no-code UX: Fin: Teams can analyze, train, test, and deploy Fin without vendor input or engineering support Competitors: These competitors require customers to reach out to change even minor configurations (ie. tone of voice). Helpdesks that offer AI Agents Zendesk AI (Zendesk)

Agentforce (Salesforce) These platforms promise AI that is fully integrated into the helpdesk. In reality, AI is bolted onto outdated systems. Setup is slow, performance is average, and costs increase without delivering meaningful ROI. Purpose-Built AI Agent: Fin: Fin is designed from the ground up as a standalone AI agent. Zendesk: Salesforce:

Seamless Integrations and Flexibility: Fin: Fin works with Zendesk, Salesforce, and other major helpdesks, so teams can keep their workflows and upgrade their AI instantly. Zendesk: Because Zendesk AI only integrates with their helpdesk, moving to a different helpdesk system will mean changing your AI solution too. Salesforce: Because Agentforce only integrates with Service Cloud, moving to a different helpdesk system will mean changing your AI solution too.

Transparent Pricing: Fin: Fin is priced at $0.99 per resolution, with no hidden fees. Zendesk: Charges up to $2 per resolution if you go into overages - penalizing you for using AI. Salesforce: With Agentforce, you pay per action meaning that costs vary massively depending on the complexity of the case. These costs increase with additional sandbox fees.  [Source]

1. Naming Guidance - Do’s and Dont’s [The do’s and don’t of how to represent Fin]

The official product name is Fin AI Agent. It is our one and only AI agent product. We always refer to it externally as “Fin AI Agent.” You can refer to Fin as ‘an AI agent’. For example: “Fin, Intercom’s AI agent” “Fin, the #1 AI agent in customer service” Once context is established, it’s also appropriate to refer to it simply as Fin. For example: “Fin AI Agent handles your frontline support. Fin delivers the highest-quality answers and resolves even the most complex queries.” Fin AI Agent is available with a customer’s existing help desk—like Zendesk, Salesforce, or paired with Intercom’s helpdesk as part of the Intercom Customer Service Suite. When speaking to customers who use another helpdesk, you can refer to: Fin for Zendesk Fin for Salesforce or Fin for Service Cloud Fin for [insert platform] Do not: Refer to “Fin 2” as a standalone product ->“Fin 2” refers to the second-generation capabilities of Fin AI Agent—not a separate product Use the term “Fin standalone” externally -> This is an internal term only, used to describe the version of Fin AI Agent purchased for use with other customer service platforms (like Zendesk or Salesforce). Do not position Fin as a platform -> Fin is an AI agent, not a platform.
