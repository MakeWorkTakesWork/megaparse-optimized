### # Fin Tasks VS. Workflows


Workflows are a powerful automation tool designed for structured processes that follow
predetined paths. They work well for predictable scenarios where clear decision trees
guide support interactions but they are hard to scale and maintain as use cases and
scenarios increase. Fin Tasks modernize Workflows by introducing Al-driven adaptability
to identify the right situation, automate more parts of complex workflows without
compromising on safety and reliability

Example: A Workflow efficiently routes common troubleshooting issues using predefined
steps and only triggers when customers choose from a list of specific options, while a Fin

Task dynamically interprets customer requests in natural language and decides the best
course of action


### Fin Tasks VS. Data connectors


Data connectors are designed for simple, single-step API calls that fetch or update
information in external systems. They are ideal for quick lookups and updates that require
minimal logic. Fin Tasks, on the other hand, manage multi-step workTIOWS, allowing Al to
make decisions and take action based on multiple inputs.

Example: Actions retrieve an order status to generate a personalized answer, while a Fin
Task processes an order cancellation, checks refund eligibility, and completes the refund
if applicable.


### Fin Tasks VS. Fin Guidance


Fin Guidance customizes Fin's behavior in terms of communication style, clarification
steps and escalation rules across all support requests to ensure alignment with company
policies and best practices. Guidance influences Fin's responses but does automate
complex processes. Fin Tasks, execute multi-step processes that require Al-driven
decisions and automated actions to resolve specific support requests reliably.

Example: Fin Guidance ensures Fin is extra polite when responding to a refund request,
while a Fin Task automates the refund process based on eligibility rules.
