Snippets are specifically for text based content, SO you will not be able to add images.
In order to get the best results, we recommend following these best practices.


### # Save it


When you've finished writing the snippet, or you want to navigate away from the editor,
you can click Save in the top right of the screen to save your changes.

# Note:

Your snippet will also be auto-saved every few seconds while you're working in
the editor. If your changes have been autosaved, the Save button will be grayed
out and you can simply click on Cancel to exit the editor.

There is no "Save as draft" option for snippets. When snippets are saved, this is
the information that becomes available to customers through Fin Al (if enabled).

### # Best practices for creating effective snippets for Fin


Snippets are a powerful tool to ensure Al agents, like Fin, can provide accurate and helpful
responses to customer queries. Follow these best practices to optimize your snippets for
clarity and functionality:


### # 1. Avoid ambiguity


Clear Titles: Ensure the snippet title explicitly defines the product, feature, or service
it pertains to. Avoid vague or overly broad terms.


### 09


Specific Content: The body of the snippet should leave no room for misinterpretation 00
Clearly explain the topic to eliminate confusion.


### 2. Restate questions in the body


To enhance Fin's ability to match customer questions with snippets, restate the
content from the title in the snippet's body. For example:


### o Title: "How to reset your password"


o Body: "If you're looking for instructions on how to reset your password...


### # 3. Use headers for structure


For longer snippets (200+ words), divide the content into distinct sections using
headers (H1 or H2). Each header should succinctly summarize the information that
follows.

o Example:


### Header: "Steps to Reset Your Password"



### Content: "Follow these steps to reset your password...



### # 4. Utilize lists

Break down detailed information into lists instead of lengthy paragraphs. Fin is better
at processing and delivering structured, concise points.

o Example:

Instead of: "To reset your password, go to the login page, click on 'Forgot
Password, enter your email address, and follow the instructions sent to your
inbox."

Use:


### Go to the login page.



### Click on "Forgot Password."



### [Image: unknown]



### Enter your email address.



### Follow the instructions sent to your inbox.



### # 5. Optimize snippet titles with variations


Include multiple variations of the question or topic in the snippet title. Separate these
variations using punctuation such as slashes (), question marks (?), or commas G).

o Example:

Title: "How to reset password / Forgot password / Password recovery
instructions"

Since snippet titles aren't visible to customers, you can make them as descriptive and
lengthy as needed to cover various phrasings customers might use.

customers.
