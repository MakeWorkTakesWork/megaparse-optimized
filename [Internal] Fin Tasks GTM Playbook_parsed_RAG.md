### # Part 1



### # Updates — Fin Tasks Availability & Support



### Verified | Last updated: May 19 | INTERNAL ONLY


Reach out on #fin-tasks-public for questions/concerns on this process.


### # Key updates on Fin Tasks Availability


# TLDR status:

Fin Tasks will	remain in closed beta for now and won’t be made broadly available in the near term. In future, we expect to have a simpler version of Fin Tasks that will be made available to all customers and an advanced version with limited or managed access. (ETA not yet available)

In the meantime, we’re tightening who gets access and support. See what this means for existing Fin Tasks users

Going forward, access and support will only be provided to customers who meet at least one of these criteria:


### 15,000+ monthly conversations (VHV- ICP A, B, C), or



## Marked as AAA or AA strategic accounts in Salesforce, or



### A Compete opportunity


🚩Additional criteria to receive R&D support for customer use cases that need data connectors: Customer APIs must be ready to build the data connector integrations

Next steps for GTM teams:
1. Check eligibility and submit your request in #success-engineering-requests. If a customer meets the above requirements, the team will enable access via a feature flag within 2 days.

Note: If you’ve previously applied and your customer hasn’t been opted in yet, please submit a new request

1. For Sales & Marketing teams, our current guidance is to continue to pitch Fin’s overall capability to handle complex support requests. See Messaging you can use here


### # FAQs & Recommended Messaging



### # Why did we make this decision?


From Alpha and Closed Beta, we’ve learned:

Fin Tasks deliver the most value for high-volume customers with strong technical readiness (especially those using APIs)

The setup process often requires hands-on support to succeed

Support processes being automated are high-stakes, and success depends on close collaboration

Based on this, we’re exploring a simpler version for all customers, while providing access and support to a more selective group of customers where we can currently add the most value.


## # What does this mean for Sales Pitches?


For Sales, current guidance is to continue to pitch Fin’s overall capability to handle complex support requests via Fin Tasks, but do not commit access or technical support on Fin Tasks until you've confirmed the following about the customer:


### Is VHV, Strategic, or Compete, and



### Has API readiness (if using data connectors)


Recommend messaging in Sales pitches:

“Fin doesn’t just answer questions—it can take action, like issuing refunds or updating account details. That’s powered by Fin Tasks. Fin Tasks are currently available to select customers to ensure they get the maximum value from this capability. We’ll work with you to assess fit during discovery and bring it in when we know it’ll drive value.”

# What does this mean for existing customers who have Fin Tasks access?

If your customer has access but no draft Task and doesn’t meet the new criteria, access will be removed.

Recommended messaging:

“Fin Tasks remain in closed beta, and we’re narrowing access to focus on customers who are best set up to succeed. Since your team hasn’t started building a Task and doesn’t meet our current criteria, we’ll be removing access for now. We’re actively working on a simpler version of the product and would love to reconnect when that becomes available.”

If your customer has access and a draft task, but doesn’t meet the new criteria, no action is needed, but we recommend resetting expectations.

Recommended messaging:

“Your team can continue to try Fin Tasks. However, we’re currently focusing set-up support on customers who’re most likely to find success with the current product: typically those with higher support volumes

and technical readiness. We’re actively working on a version of the product that will work better for your needs”

# What does this mean for existing customers who want Fin Tasks access but are not eligible?

Recommended messaging:

Fin Tasks are currently in closed beta. We want to ensure that customers who use Fin Tasks get the maximum value from the capability and are set up for success. We’re currently focusing access and set-up support on customers who’re most likely to find success with the current product: typically those with higher support volumes and technical readiness. We’re actively working on a version of the product that will work better for your needs”


### # How do eligible customers get access?


GTM Teams need to fill the request form in #success-engineering-requests . Fin Tasks team will enable access via a feature flag within 2 days.


### # What kind of support is provided to eligible customers?


An engineer is assigned to help the customer implement and test their Tasks and they further work with the Fin Tasks team if additional support is needed.


### # How should we position Fin Tasks pricing?


Fin Tasks are currently part of the broader Fin offering and do not carry separate pricing at this time.


### # What about Custom Answers for non-eligible customers?


If a customer’s use case requires Custom Answers but they aren’t eligible for Fin Tasks, reach out in #fin-tasks-public.

### Part 3



### # How Guidance, Tasks, Workflows, and Actions work with Fin



### Verified and up to date for: Q2 FY26 | INTERNAL ONLY


Here’s how Tasks fit with Guidance, Workflows, and Data Connectors:

Feature What it Does When to Use Notes Tasks Teach Fin to handle specific, multi-step processes like refunds or account updates using natural language and rule-based steps. When you want Fin to manage complex, multi-step processes triggered by natural language. Best for high-effort, logic-driven requests. Full control with conversational flow. Guidance Train Fin to deliver accurate answers and escalate issues based on your communication style and policies. When you want Fin to match your tone, apply escalation rules, and ensure policy-aligned support. Does not perform actions, but governs how Fin speaks, clarifies and escalates. Data connectors (previously Actions) Enable Fin to access data  in external systems (e.g., API calls), triggered by Fin, Fin Tasks, or Workflows When you need Fin to fetch or update external data as part of a Fin task, Workflow, or Inbox workflow. Used by Fin directly to generate personalized answers. Also used *within* Tasks or Workflows. Workflows Automate operational workflows like ticket triage, lead qualification, and proactive support with hard-coded paths. When automating standard support ops that don’t require flexibility but follow structured, known paths. Can become hard to scale and maintain as edge cases increase. Custom Answers (will not be available for new customers) Train Fin to answer simple, single-turn questions with specific, predefined answers. When you want Fin to give a very specific answer to a straightforward question—no disambiguation needed. Deprecated. Recommended to migrate to Tasks for better flexibility and scale.


### # Fin Tasks vs. Workflows


Workflows are a powerful automation tool designed for structured processes that follow predefined paths. They work well for predictable scenarios where clear decision trees guide support interactions but they are hard to scale and maintain as use cases and scenarios increase. Fin Tasks modernize Workflows by introducing AI-driven adaptability to identify the right situation, automate more parts of complex workflows without compromising on safety and reliability

Example: A Workflow efficiently routes common troubleshooting issues using predefined steps and only triggers when customers choose from a list of specific options, while a Fin Task dynamically interprets customer requests in natural language and decides the best course of action


### # Fin Tasks vs. Data connectors


Data connectors are designed for simple, single-step API calls that fetch or update information in external systems. They are ideal for quick lookups and updates that require minimal logic. Fin Tasks, on the other hand, manage multi-step workflows, allowing AI to make decisions and take action based on multiple inputs.

Example: Actions retrieve an order status to generate a personalized answer, while a Fin Task processes an order cancellation, checks refund eligibility, and completes the refund if applicable.


### Fin Tasks vs. Fin Guidance


Fin Guidance customizes Fin’s behavior in terms of communication style, clarification steps and escalation rules across all support requests to ensure alignment with company policies and best practices. Guidance influences Fin’s responses but does automate complex processes. Fin Tasks, execute multi-step processes that require AI-driven decisions and automated actions to resolve specific support requests reliably.

Example: Fin Guidance ensures Fin is extra polite when responding to a refund request, while a Fin Task automates the refund process based on eligibility rules.

Consider starting from lower risk workflows where the customer would be comfortable to try things out


### For prospects



### Assess their query volume breakdown in discovery


Research their business and website to understand potential support requests that may be action-based

Can they provide API access or are open to doing so with support?

Many Tasks rely on APIs to fetch or update data—know which ones are needed, their outputs, and how they'll be used.

Do they have cross-functional support from product or eng as needed?

Task setup often needs input from product, engineering, or ops—especially for new or updated APIs. Clear workflow alignment ensures the right systems are in place.

Are they open to testing and iteration while setting up a Fin Task?

Building great Tasks is rarely a one-shot effort. Expect to test different approaches with Task instructions, debug edge cases, and refine as you go to improve reliability and end-user experience.


### # 💡Understanding Customer Motivations (Before Scenarios)


Example customer quotes: “We’re getting bogged down in repetitive tasks.” “Our agents are spending too much time on actions, not just answers.” “We want to automate more, but we’re not sure where to start.” “We’re exploring ways to operationalize AI beyond just chatbots.”


### 1. Manual Human Involvement


Complex support requests like refunds, identity checks, or troubleshooting required human agents.

Teams were bogged down by repetitive, high-effort tasks, reducing their time for higher-value work.


### 2. Rigid Automation Tools


Traditional automation solutions (like workflows) were hard to scale and maintain.

These tools required detailed decision trees and manual setup, making them brittle and inflexible for evolving support scenarios.


### 3. Poor Customer Experience



### End users had to navigate confusing menus and buttons.


Customer interactions were not conversational, often relying on form-filling and static UI components.


### 4. Limited AI Capability



### Most AI agents handled only simple, informational queries.


They failed on multi-step processes or returned unreliable results when trying to act beyond their scope.


### 5. Inconsistent Support


Manual execution led to variability in how requests were handled.

There was limited control and oversight, leading to possible errors or inconsistent outcomes.

# 🕳️  Highlighting Challenges and Risks (Trap-Setting Questions)

“How do you currently handle support requests that go beyond simple FAQs—like refunds or account changes?”
→ Reveals if they’re relying on manual work or rigid systems.

“What happens when a customer asks for something that requires multiple systems or approvals?”
→ Exposes friction, delays, or lack of integration.

“How often do your agents have to step in because your automation couldn’t complete the task?”

### # 🧩 Required Capabilities


As you hear customer needs, map them to Fin Tasks capabilities:

Customer Need Fin Tasks Capabilities Automatically detect what the customer needs Fin automatically detects customer intent to trigger the correct task, without needing complex setups. Example: If a customer says "I don't recognize this charge," Fin identifies it as a dispute and starts the resolution flow. Take multiple steps reliably Fin Tasks allow Fin to multi-step workflows, allowing AI to make decisions at each step without manual intervention. Fin can gather information, ask clarifying questions, take actions in external systems, and pause to wait for data from webhooks—all based on predefined rules. Connect to external systems and APIs Fin connects to external systems via Data connectors to fetch or update information dynamically during conversations, enabling seamless real-time backend operations. Keep customers informed at each step "See Fin's Thinking" feature allows customers to view the real-time progress of their request, increasing transparency. Easy to set up and manage with scale AI-generated instructions assist by drafting task workflows automatically based on natural language inputs. Starter templates are available for common tasks (e.g., refunds, account changes), making setup fast and efficient. Teams can test tasks with specific user personas (like VIPs or new customers) to validate functionality before going live. Intercom's "Tasks Squad" offers expert help for faster deployment and optimization. Fin uses Instruction Blocks to allow conversational, natural language input instead of relying on forms, buttons, or menus. Make entire support conversational, not just easy questions Customers can say things like “I want to change my shipping address” or “I need a refund,” and Fin starts gathering details and taking action. No buttons, no forms—so your entire support experience becomes conversational, not just the simple questions.


### # 📏 Measuring Success (Metrics to Track)


Frame success around what matters most to decision-makers—efficiency, consistency, and impact:

Agent Time Saved
→ Measure reduction in manual handling of multi-step requests (e.g., ID checks, refunds).
“How many hours of human work has Fin taken off your team’s plate?”

Ticket Volume Reduction
→ Track decrease in escalations or tickets requiring agent intervention.
“What percentage of complex requests are now fully resolved by Fin?”

Task Resolution Rate
→ Monitor how often Fin completes Tasks without errors or human review.
“Is Fin reliably completing the workflows you’ve defined?”


| Customer | Experience |
| --- | --- |
| → Capture | how easy customers find getting help—no forms, no menus. |
| “How often | do customers solve issues in a single, natural conversation?” |
| ### # 2. | Resources |
| ### # Objection | Handling |
| When selling | Fin Tasks, it's essential to anticipate and address common objections that potential customers may have. Here are some typical objections and how to handle them: |
| ### Complexity | of Setup |
| Before | Scenario: Rigid Automation Tools - Traditional automation solutions (like workflows) were hard to scale and maintain. These tools required detailed decision trees and manual setup, making them brittle and inflexible for evolving support scenarios. |
| Key ICP: | ICP C. Mid-sized companies with high conversation volumes but fewer resources may find the setup complexity daunting. They are likely to be concerned about the ease of implementation and the potential need for additional technical support. |
| ### Objection: | "Setting up Fin Tasks seems complicated." |
| Response: | Emphasize that Fin Tasks are designed for easier setup using natural language, eliminating the need for complex workflows or decision trees. While there may be initial setup time, these will be easier to manage and maintain long term. |


Show how a lot of support to make things easier has been built into the product itself: get help using the ‘get help’ option when on the Fin Tasks page, starter templates, including third party templates for Shopify, Statuspage and Stripe that can be repurposed for common use cases. We also have AI generated task instructions where customers can get help to generate the right prompts.


### Control Over Automation


Before Scenario: Inconsistent Support - Manual execution led to variability in how requests were handled. There was limited control and oversight, leading to possible errors or inconsistent outcomes.

Key ICP: ICP B. Large enterprises with substantial customer interactions and a significant workforce will prioritize control and accuracy in automation to avoid errors that could impact their large-scale operations.

Objection: "We need to ensure that automation doesn't lead to errors."

Response: Highlight that Fin Tasks allow for a high level of control and reliability. Customers can define specific business rules and conditions, ensuring that Fin operates within their guidelines and reduces the risk of errors. Showcase testing and preview capabilities for Fin Tasks and also how customers will be able to see what actions Fin is taking to diagnose and understand errors.


### Integration with Existing Systems


Before Scenario: Limited AI Capability -  Most AI agents handled only simple, informational queries. They failed on multi-step processes or returned unreliable results when trying to act beyond their scope.

Key ICP: ICP A. High-profile companies that influence the market will be particularly concerned about seamless integration with their existing sophisticated systems to maintain operational efficiency and avoid disruptions.

Objection: "Will Fin Tasks integrate well with our current systems?"

Response: Reassure customers that Fin Tasks are built to connect with existing systems through API calls, allowing for seamless integration. Provide case studies of similar businesses that have successfully integrated Fin Tasks.


### Cost Concerns


Before Scenario: Manual Human Involvement - Complex support requests like refunds, identity checks, or troubleshooting required human agents. Teams were bogged down by repetitive, high-effort tasks, reducing their time for higher-value work.

Key ICP: ICP D. Smaller companies with significant but manageable conversation volumes are more likely to be sensitive to additional costs, especially if they are in the growth phase and managing tight budgets.


### Objection: "Is this going to be an additional cost?"


Response: Clarify that during the closed beta phase, Fin Tasks are available at no additional cost to existing Fin customers. This allows them to explore the benefits without financial commitment.


### Effectiveness Compared to Traditional Workflows


Before Scenario: Rigid Automation Tools - Traditional automation solutions (like workflows) were hard to scale and maintain. These tools required detailed decision trees and manual setup, making them brittle and inflexible for evolving support scenarios.

Key ICP: ICP C. Mid-sized companies that have invested in traditional workflows may be skeptical about switching to a new system and will need convincing evidence of the benefits and improvements offered by Fin Tasks.

Objection: "How do Fin Tasks compare to our current workflows?"

Response: Explain that while traditional workflows work well for many complex processes, they need to start with hard-coded trigger messages, can get increasingly complex and hard to maintain as the business grows. They also involve the use of menus, buttons, forms for end customers which means that while the informational side of support is conversational with Fin, the action based side of support is still clunky and old school, creating an inconsistent end customer experience, Fin Tasks are designed for complex, multi-step processes and bring together the best of both worlds: the efficiency and conversational nature of AI and the control and reliability of hard-coded workflows.


### Uncertainty About AI Reliability


Before Scenario: Inconsistent Support - Manual execution led to variability in how requests were handled. There was limited control and oversight, leading to possible errors or inconsistent outcomes.

Key ICP: ICP B. Large enterprises handling sensitive and high-stakes customer interactions will be particularly concerned about the reliability and trustworthiness of AI solutions to ensure they meet their stringent operational standards.


### Objection: "Can we trust AI to handle sensitive tasks?"


Response: Address this concern by discussing the built-in safeguards that allow for identity verification and the ability to review and approve actions before they are executed. Customers can add hard-coded steps to take the guesswork out of how the Task will be

executed. This ensures that sensitive tasks are handled with the necessary oversight but AI still brings in scale and efficiency to repetitive work.


### # Success Stories/Case Studies/Quotes


This product is in early stages, more real customer use cases and live task showcases coming soon.


### Evidence Library Link


“Before Fin, handling refund requests for accidental credit usage was a slow, manual process. Now, Fin has made things so much easier - users get their credits back quickly while we still maintain full control over approvals. It’s made our refund process smoother, faster, and more reliable, all without the complexity of building complex flows and training agents to follow them.”


### George Dilthey, Head of Support at Clay

## # Fin Tasks — Quick Guide to success



### James Cash Afonso Marques


# Welcome! Follow this playbook to make your Fin Tasks consistent, quick and customer‑friendly.


### # 1 Why reliability matters


A task is reliable when it:

Runs the same way every time given the same input (consistency).


### Delivers the correct outcome (quality).


Loose or missing instructions force the Fin to guess—and guesses vary. Precise steps remove that variance.


### # 2 Task anatomy (at a glance)



### Trigger  → (Instruction blocks or Deterministic blocks)



### 


Instruction Blocks
Fin uses the instructions in these blocks flexibly—skipping, repeating, or looping on steps as is needed based on conversation context. This creates a natural, intelligent, and human-like flow.

Deterministic Blocks
Fin executes these blocks exactly as designed in the task, in a fixed order. They create a more structured, linear experience and always run as designed. EG (Path branching, assign to team, show reply button)

Part Purpose New‑builder tip When to use Trigger Starts the task (Use natural language to describe when Fin should trigger the task) Keep it narrow—one user intent per task. Give Fin positive and negative examples of customer utterances. Always Instruction block Ordered steps + optional Guidance + Complete when. Built in tools: Read, Update attributes, Use data connector, Tag conversation, escalate to human One instruction block = one sub‑goal in the overall task. Complete when:  High level patterns that work: Check if an attribute is updated and or user language (user confirms it was a success combined with asking the user to confirm on the last step) Lower risk, conversational step and interactions with users You need to use Fin’s AI to reason about data, make decisions or analyse images Determasitic block Click “Add step” see all blocks → Branching, reply buttons, Assign.. Etc Pass data to deterministic branching steps from Instruction blocks using temporary attributes Make critical decisions eg “If is_eligible_for_refund” branch to Path A else go to Path B

# 3 Instruction block: Step patterns (guidelines, not hard rules)

Think of these as lego blocks. You can mix‑and‑match:

Pattern Description Real‑world example Action + Reason (+ Speak) Why it works → Data fetch, decision, and communication all in one forward‑moving unit. Step: Call get_order_details → IF status == "shipped" THEN set ↟order_status = shipped AND tell the user: “Your order shipped on {{ship_date}}.” Action + Speak No extra reasoning needed—just fetch & report. Step: Call track_package(tracking_number) → immediately reply: “Here’s your tracking link: {{tracking_url}}.” Reason + Speak All data already in attributes; just apply logic and communicate. Step: IF ↟session_date < now()+10 m THEN tell learner: “The classroom opens 10 minutes before start time.”

Not a checkbox list. Combine patterns as needed—e.g. Action + Reason in one step, then Ask. Just avoid steps that only “reason” or only broadcast info the user can’t respond to.


### # 4 Instruction block: Writing strong steps


Merge “reason‑only” steps
Bad: Step 1 reason → Step 2 store variable.
Good: Store variables and decide the next action, all in one step.


### One data connector per step for speed & simpler retries.


Ground every fact
Fetch or ask before stating it; add Guidance:
“Only mention data fetched via actions or attributes. If missing, ask the user.”


### Crisp Complete‑when


END when ↟order_cancelled = true OR user confirmed the task was sucessful


### 


# 5 Instruction block: Should you put an instruction in Guidance or a Step?

Put in step Put in Guidance Sentences and messages for the end‑user, only applies to that step Behaviour rules that apply to every step in the block, avoid putting message user instructions or it will be repeated every step

If text appears only once or only applies to that step , keep it in the step. Guidance is meta‑level.


### # 6 Testing loop — Create → Preview → Iterate



### Start small: build the minimal happy‑path steps.


Preview with a real user message (copy‑paste an example chat). In the event log watch:
* Fin’s raw thoughts to help you debug
* API calls & attribute writes
* Final message latency.


### Identify noise



### Repeated info? Merge steps.



### Hallucinated facts? Fetch or ask before speaking.


Instruction block too early/too Late completion? Adjust the "Complete When" condition and/or revisit the final step of the task to adjust desired end-task behaviour

Tweak & Preview again until the same input yields the same (good) output twice in a row.

Example – Colour‑choice task
Initial run: Fin goes Step 1 think → Step 2 store → Step 3 message (3 messages in UI).
Fix: Merge Step 1+2 → new preview shows one clear message, no duplication.
Confirm again with a second preview. Task passes ✓.


### # 7 Channel notes


Email – Combine greeting + answer in the first step to avoid multiple email parts.

Hyperlinks – Fin task supports [text](url). For dynamic links, build URL via action and insert attribute.


### # 8 Common pitfalls & quick fixes


Symptom Cause Quick fix Fin keeps prompting after user says thanks Complete‑when might check attributes that did not update Add explicit END in the final step. (user confirms it was a success combined with asking the user to confirm on the last step) Raw URLs in chat V2 lacks anchor links Upgrade to V3 or accept raw URL.


### # 9 Builder launch checklist ✓



### The trigger is narrow and clear.



### Steps follow one of the four patterns—no “think‑only”.



### Facts fetched before referenced.



### Complete‑when checking attributes and or user confirmation.



### Preview passes twice with identical output.


It’s tempting to try to design every edge case, but instruction blocks are most effective when they’re focused and simple. Over-optimizing for rare scenarios can actually hurt the common ones. Once you've reached a version that handles the main flows well, it’s okay to stop—escalute to humans for rare sub paths instead of trying to create over optimised tasks on day 1. We encourage an iterative and incremental approach to creating complex tasks.

# APPENDIX:


### Give Fin Tasks [beta]


Fin Tasks allow you to automate more complex processes with Fin. Often times, these processes may involve connections to your external systems that need to reliably follow your specific business rules (e.g. cancel an order, refund a subscription). Fin will trigger the task and be actively involved each step to resolve customer queries.

Fin Tasks is currently in a closed beta. If you're interested in getting access, please speak to your Intercom Relationship or Customer Success Manager.


### # How Fin Tasks work


Here's what a Fin task might look like:

Check out Fin Tasks in action:

Fin handles refund requests & updating email addresses on bookings

Fin handles transaction disputes & updating personal details

# Why are Fin Tasks smarter and more powerful than traditional workflows?


### # Easier setup with natural language


Rather than using conventional workflows built by adding multiple steps—messages, branches, actions—you can set up Fin Tasks using natural language.

You also no longer have to build complex decision trees to guide the user down the correct path based on their query; all of this can be handled by a simple description of a single Fin Task.

# Automate more processes with AI that typically required a human

Using Fin Tasks, Fin can handle interactions that would otherwise require human action. For example, Fin can take a customer through extensive troubleshooting steps or analyze images of damaged orders from customers. These AI-driven enhancements reduce manual workload while ensuring customers receive fast, accurate, and intelligent responses—without needing human intervention


### # Create a more conversational customer experience


Fin Tasks eliminate the need for customers to click through multiple buttons to reach the right solution. The entire experience feels much more natural and conversational, making it easier and more intuitive for customers to get the help they need.

For instance, you can instruct Fin to collect data as part of a task and instead of providing an input box for the user to type into, Fin will conversationally say something like “Can you please specify the subscription you are referring to?”

# What's the difference between Fin Tasks and Data connectors?

You may have heard about our Data connectors feature. Both Data connectors and Tasks can be triggered by Fin, and they share a key similarity: You define a natural language description of when they should trigger, and Fin automatically activates them when a customer’s question matches. So, what sets them apart?


### Data connectors: Simple, Single-Step API Calls


A Data connector is a single API call, best suited for straightforward, single-turn customer questions.

For example:


### "What’s the status of my order?"


This requires a simple response—either the order is fulfilled or it isn’t. Fin can handle this by making a single API request to retrieve the order status.


### Fin Tasks: Multi-Step, Logic-Driven Flows


A Fin Task (the focus of this article) is more powerful. It combines multiple Data connectors (API calls) with your business logic, making it ideal for multi-turn customer questions.

For example:


### "I’d like a refund for my order."


This is more complex:

Fin may need to first check if the customer is eligible for a refund.


### It might also verify if they’ve previously requested one.


The process could involve multiple API calls—one to fetch order details and another to issue the refund if eligibility criteria are met.

We recommend to use Data connectors for the simple use cases and Fin Tasks for the more complex ones.


### # Get started with Fin Tasks


# What to consider when setting up Fin Tasks and Data connectors

Setting up Fin Tasks and Data connectors takes a blend of technical awareness, process thinking, and collaboration. While the experience is becoming easier over time, here are the key areas to focus on:

Choose high-impact processes to automate: Start by identifying 1–2 workflows where automation could meaningfully reduce support volume. Look for repeatable processes that currently rely on human intervention. Your Intercom Overview report is a great place to spot trends and uncover common issues being routed to your team.

Understand your API requirements: Many Tasks depend on connecting to APIs to fetch or update data (i.e Data connectors). Make sure you know which APIs are needed, what they return, and how they’ll be used within the Task.

Work cross-functionally: Setting up Tasks often requires input from product, engineering, or operations teams—especially when APIs need to be built or updated. Clear communication around the desired workflow ensures the right systems are in place.

Test and iterate: Building great Tasks is rarely a one-shot effort. Expect to test different approaches with Task instructions, debug edge cases, and refine as you go to improve reliability and end-user experience.

Getting these fundamentals right will help you launch faster and build more effective Fin-powered Tasks.

# How does Fin decide whether to trigger a Task, Data Connector, or content-based answer?

Fin evaluates all three—Tasks, Data Connectors, and content based answers—at the same priority level. It selects the best match based on user intent. If the query leads down the content-based answer path, Fin prioritizes Custom Answers over general knowledge content or snippets.


### # Create a Fin Task



### Visit Fin AI Agent > Train > Tasks and click on New task.



### # 1. Give your task trigger a title and description


Every Fin task should be given a title telling Fin when to trigger the task. This is very important, so that Fin triggers it at the right time.

Similarly to the title, the description also tells Fin when it should trigger the task, in greater detail. This describes the situation Fin should use the

task, provide example customer queries, and could also call out situations where Fin should not use this task.

Read our best practices for writing a task title and description.


### # 2. Set channels and audience rules


The task trigger is also where you define the channels and audience rules which need to match before Fin performs the task.


### # 3. Add instructions


Use the instructions block to give Fin custom instructions to perform the task. You can template the instructions with data, get Fin to use Data connectors, store response data and reply to users.

Provide as much information as possible in the instructions, any information not provided may be incorrectly inferred by Fin.

Start each instruction with a verb. Be clear, concise, and as complete as possible. Long instructions are less reliable so use multiple steps for each instruction if needed.

Fin can send a one-time password to the customer’s email and require them to enter it before performing the task.


### Read our best practices for writing effective instructions.



### # AI-generated task instructions


With AI-generated task instructions, you can simply describe what you want Fin to do and it will automatically generate a structured task prompt.

This allows for:

Faster setup: Skip the blank page and let AI do the heavy lifting!

Better structure: Generated prompts follow best practices for Fin Tasks —complete with steps, end conditions, and optional guidance.

Easy to edit: Once generated, prompts are fully editable, so you can tweak and customize as needed.


### # Add Data connectors optional


Data connectors can be used in the instruction block to retrieve or update data in an external system. Add a Data connector by typing "@" in line with your text instructions and click Connect to external, then select one of your pre-configured Data connectors.

Note: You'll need to configure Data connectors before you can use them in Fin Tasks. For more info on how to design and use your APIs with Data connectors, go to this article.

The response data from the Data connector will become available as "temporary attributes" within the instructions block (see below).


### # Use attributes optional


Add attributes to the instructions block by typing "@" in line with your text instructions. This allows Fin to read and update attributes based on your specific business rules, at clear moments, with precise values. You can use any people/company/conversation/temporary attribute.


### # Use temporary attributes


Temporary attributes are useful when you need data only for the current task and don't want to save it permanently in Intercom for reporting or other purposes. You can create these attributes to hold information that's relevant to the specific task being executed.

For example you can create a temporary attribute to:


### Capture a customer's selected booking ID



### Customer’s preferred delivery date



### Ask Fin to classify user query or collect some data


Learn more about attributes and how they can power Fin Tasks and Data connectors.


### # Tell Fin when a task is complete


In the "End this task when" section, specify the conditions that indicate the task is complete. This helps Fin avoid ending the task too early, repeating steps, or getting stuck. Define clear criteria for completion, regardless of whether it's a positive or negative outcome for the customer.


## # Guide how Fin behaves during a task optional


Guide how Fin interacts, responds, and behaves during a task by providing clear guidance. Simply describe any specific behaviors you’d like Fin to follow while performing the steps.

Note: Fin will combine any global Fin Guidance you've set with any custom guidance you add here.


### # Use "Wait for webhook" optional


Use Wait for webhook to pause the task until it receives a webhook request. This is ideal for processes that require external input before moving forward.

Imagine your task needs to integrate with an external system—such as a third-party application for identity verification. With Wait for webhook, the task stops at this step until the external system sends a webhook response. Once received, the task resumes and takes action based on the provided data.


### Examples


Identity Verification: Pause the task until a third-party service confirms a user's identity.

Payment Confirmation: Wait for a webhook from your payment provider to confirm a transaction before proceeding.

Order Fulfillment: Pause until your inventory system sends an update about stock availability.

Approval Processes: Hold the task until a third-party tool sends an approval or rejection status.

This feature ensures your tasks are seamless and synchronized with external systems, reducing manual intervention and keeping things efficient! To add Wait for webhook to your task, simply click Add step and search for “Wait for webhook”.


### Best practices when using "Wait for webhook"


Add a clear name to the step to make it easy to identify temporary variables created for the step

Configure the example request properly by including all the fields you expect to receive in the webhook callback within the data object.

Ensure the webhook returns a JSON body that matches the structure in the step. If the JSON structure is updated, no data will be received. Missing fields in the configuration will also make those fields inaccessible in the task.

Click the "Copy" button to copy the webhook URL to your clipboard. On the third-party site where the webhook is triggered, ensure the conversationId is passed as expected.

Note: The webhook endpoint supports idempotency to safely retry requests and prevent the same operation from being performed more than once.

When sending a request, include an 'Idempotency-Key' header with a unique value. We recommend using UUIDs. Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours.


### # Test and preview Fin Tasks


Open the Fin Task, click on Preview and ask a question. Use the Customer view tab to test the interactions with Fin.


### Note: A Fin Task must be saved before it can be previewed.


Use the Event log tab to see what Fin is doing in the background.

Once you're happy with how Fin performs the task, go ahead and select Set live to let Fin get to work! 💪


### # Report on Fin Task resolutions


You can use the Fin AI Agent: Fin workflow used attribute to create an inbox view and monitor conversations where a task was used.

You can also use this attribute in Reports and combine it with the Fin AI Agent resolution rate attribute.
