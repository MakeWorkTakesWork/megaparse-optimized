### # From Insights to Day 5 Analyze, Train, Test, Deploy


1 week ago we launched Insights. A really powerful and compelling product update. We brought new invention to the market with the CX Score, Topics Explorer, and one-click Suggestions with creates a Fin flywheel and self-improving system. This is a huge step forward for Fin, and a clear signal to the market that we are leading this new category. We’re already hearing a lot of very positive customer feedback. If you’ve haven’t demo’d Insights to your customers yet, do it! Today we’re going to share our higher level thinking, explaining that Fin is now in its 3rd phase of maturity with an AI Agent System which continually improves.

AI Agents in Customer Service have gone through two phases of maturity, and last week we announced that Fin has moved into phase 3. The first was answering informational queries: the frequently asked questions managed by frontline support where the answers are the same for everyone. This requires an up to date knowledge base, and Fin to understand brand and tone of voice. Fin has been doing all frontline support for many customers since last year. The second phase was increasing Fin’s power to answer more complex queries. These are queries that require Fin to: Access personal information, connect to data systems, and be able to read and write back to these systems to complete tasks. Follow company policies, guidelines, procedures, and troubleshoot. Work across all customer channels, and in dozens of different languages. Over the past year we have built significant power into Fin, and Fin now resolves many complex queries for customers, for example failed payments, delayed deliveries, or changing the plan a customer is on. Our customers are now getting 60, 70 and even 80%+ resolution rates across informational and complex queries. Once Fin can answer both informational queries, and complex queries, the question then of course, is what next? The answer is that you need an AI Agent System to manage and optimize Fin. To get Fin answering more and more queries, and doing them better and better, resulting in an ever improving experience for your customers. Fin’s AI Agent system is a continuously improving loop, making Fin a self-improving system. Analyze. Learn how Fin is performing, and see areas for improvement. Train. Once you have decided what to improve, you can change how Fin works, for example changing policies, or systems it uses, or train it to use newer content. Test. Testing is a critical requirement for generative AI products. You need to know that the changes you made in Train are showing up as intended. Deploy. Set your changes live, on different channels. And the loop completes: learn how your changes are performing back in Analyze. We’ve entered a new phase in the maturity of AI Agents for Customer Service. Fin is the most advanced, the highest performing, and the only product that gives you total control over how you configure, test and improve, without needing any engineering resources.
