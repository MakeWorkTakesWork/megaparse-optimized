### # Fin Resolution Rate – Monthly Update



### Owners: PMM team - please reach out to Tatiana Bassil



### # Contributors: Marina Schink Pedro Tabacof



### # Last updated: June 4th



## # TLDR


Resolution rate is a core part of the Fin narrative. It’s one of the most visible and impactful metrics we share with customers and prospects - used across sales decks, marketing materials, campaigns, the website, and customer conversations. Because we use this stat so widely and frequently, it’s critical that we’re always aligned on the most up-to-date number. Even small changes can affect how Fin is perceived in terms of value, performance, and ROI.

Going forward, The PMM team will provide monthly updates to GTM teams any time Fin’s resolution rate changes. Please do not update any assets or messaging until you’ve received confirmation from the PMM team.


### # Where to track live data: Fin Launch Dashboard – Tableau



### # May Update


Fin’s average resolution rate has increased to 59%, up from 56% in April which is a significant jump.


### What changed?


Conversational Fin rollout: In early May, we launched an A/B test that removed quick reply buttons in 66% of conversations on Web Messenger. This drove a 10pp increase in resolution rate within the test group. We’ve now fully rolled this out to the first batch of customers, with phased deployment continuing in June. However, this won’t translate to a 10pp global uplift, as:

The change only works in Web Messenger (not email or other channels)

Some customers aren’t using this new update: Around 20% of customers are currently opted out (though this may drop with upcoming comms)

Some customers picked different follow-up messages which reduce the RR gain from +10pp to +5pp, but comes with a notable CSAT improvement

More gains expected in June: As remaining A/B tests are fully deployed across more regions and languages, we expect to see additional resolution rate increases in the coming weeks.That said, the staggered nature of the Conversational Fin rollout and varying adoption across configurations make it difficult to predict exactly how much improvement we’ll see, or when. Check here for more context on this rollout or watch this Build in Public video.

Upgrades from the AI team: The rollout of Sonnet 3.7, our latest model, led to a +1.2pp lift in overall resolution rate, along with other enhancements like improved retrieval and reranking models for RAG, contributing an additional ~0.5–1pp.
